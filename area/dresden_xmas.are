Bud, the famous dwarven Mercenary Master, stands here smoking a cigar.

Bud is the biggest dwarf you have ever seen.  He stands almost 4'10 and must
weigh over 300 lbs!  For his enormous size it looks like he is just a large
pile of muscles.  He carries a human sized 2 handed axe slung over one
shoulder and has on a fine vest of mithril chain mail.  Looking at the
number of scars on his body there is no doubt in your mind that Bud is
indeed the famous dragon killer known throughout the land.

Center of Christmas Tree Square.~
This is the center of the square.  It is dominated by the trunk of the biggest
Christmas tree you have ever seen.  It must be at least 10 feet in
diameter and one hundred feet tall!  As you look up, you can see some kind
of structure nestles in the branches high above you.  You also see a large
portal carved into the side of the tree, with an unearthly light emanating
from within.  Taking a closer look you see a staircase leading down into
the mighty tree.  Near the base of a tree is a sign.

For the holiday season the tree is strung with popcorn and cranberries.
Smaller evergreens have been placed at the corners of the square and
decorated with bright balls and tinsel.  Several foil wrapped boxes are
arranged under the trees.  In the interests of inclusiveness (or political
correctness if you are a cynic) a creche, a Chanukah menorah and a
set of Kwanzaa candles share equal space.

This ancient tree is a symbol of strength for our city.  The sages say it

base of the tree you can be granted the favor of the Gods.  Good luck

You must be at the heart of the tree now. The surrounding leaves are blocking
any light from penetrating. You hold tightly to the nearest branch as a breeze
causes the tree to slowly sway.   There are a number of large branches grouped
together here which seem sturdy enough to walk on.  The sounds of the city

The branches begin to get smaller and the leaf cover thinner as you climb

streaming through the canopy.  You think this would be as far as you should
climb since it could get dangerous.  Looking around you you see a wonderful
sight.  Almost all of Sembia can be seen from up here.

Corner of Wizards Way and Magic Street.~
You are on an extremely clean cobblestone street.  It does not have very much
traffic except for a robed person strolling past every now and then. It also
seems very quiet here as if disconnected from the hustle and bustle of the rest
of the city.  To the northeast the tall spires of the University of Magic
extend into the sky.

Strands of colored lights have been hung all around to celebrate the
holiday season.  There are also paper cut out menorahs and dreidels here
and there and a big lettered sign saying "Happy New Year" spans the
roadway.

You enter what seems to be a small shop from the outside and are amazed to see
how large it really is.  Every wall has shelving to the ceiling filled with
jars, pouches, and small boxes.  There are a  of racks with various
staves on them and the back of the room is filled with racks of robes
and hats.  This is a wonderful magic shop indeed!  You see a notice posted on

Dark Alley.~
Looking around the dark alleyway you see the locked back doors of some of the
buildings nearby.  The faint light that penetrates this far down the alleyway
causes shadows to dance among the door ways and walls.  With the feeling you
may not be alone you continue onward.

Tunnel on the River of Wonders.~
Rowing against the current you slowly enter a long dark tunnel that takes you
under the east walls of Dresden.  You can hear the sounds of your paddling
echoing down the dark tunnel.  As you continue to paddle onward you begin to
wonder how long this tunnel is...   You should have made it past the walls by
now for sure!  Looking around you see only darkness.

Before you is an enormous room that has no floor!  You are on a ten foot
ledge that continues along the wall of the circular room.  When you look down
the shaft ends in darkness.  Looking up you cannot see the ceiling.  While
pondering your situation you see a tall mage in long red robes float down from
above.  Aha! You realize you must practice your fly spell a little more before
attempting the upper or lowest floors of the university.

Temple of Breas.~
You are in a large room filled with benches down the center of the room.  On
the walls to either side are a number of very tall stained glass windows
depicting the Saints of the Order.  The cathedral style ceiling rises more than
thirty feet above you and peaks at a bell tower.  To the east is a broad set
of steps that lead to the altar.  West is what looks to be a prayer room and
there is a door to the north.

You notice that the room is several times the size of the tree itself
and you wonder what sort of magic created it.
    To the north is the abode of all the great hero's of the realms.  Here
it is that they come to discuss the great deeds that they have accomplished;
relax in comfort and safety; and practice and improve new and wonderous
skills that they have learned from all their great travels.
    There is a large plaque on the western wall with the names of all who
have reached the pinnacle of mortal power.  Each time someone in the realms
reaches this plateau, their name magically appears on it.

behind them.  Moving closer, you notice that he hasn't moved a muscle.  You

   After much research, the use of the mirrors has been discovered.  By
tossing a certain amount of gold into a mirror, you can view what is on
the other side of it.  For ten times the original ammount of gold, you
can actually enter the mirror and be transported to the location shown
therein. Looking into the mirror costs 500 gold peices.
