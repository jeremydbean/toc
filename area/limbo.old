3.   You were using offensive language, or were harrasing another player.

In most cases, you have been nochanneled, meaning your public channels
have been taken away.  Tell may also have been removed, but the Say
command should be functioning.  You will be released from jail if/when
the Immortal who put you here decides, or if that Immortal left a note
to the other Immortals to let you out when they see you.  In most cases
you can be let out of jail by ceasing what ever it was that got you here
