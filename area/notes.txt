Subject Balancing of the T/T class.~
Text
With the addition of the new code, it is fairly apparent that
the thieves are getting an advantage.

The following ideas are REALISTIC ideas on how to balance
the T/T class.

1) Stealth should be modified. NOT taken away by any means, just changed.
It could have a better chance of working in the night hours than the
night. The reasoning behind that is very obvious, its easier to hide in darkness
than in light. No new code would need to be added for this modification, as the
distiction between night and day is already coded in (moonray and sunray spells)

2) Thieves are not fighters. So an approach of limiting the attacks of this
class should be considered. I believe that taking away second attack would be
a signifigant modification to the class, and tone them down a bit. Theives could
keep dual wield, but reserve it for higher levels. I think that some other damage should be
modified as well. Dual wield should AUTOMATICALLY give the thief a double hitting backstab,
and in turn having haste casted upon them would NOT give them 4 attacks. If all
these suggestions were to be in affect, experience may be a little harder to
obtain, so you could reward the thieves extra experience gains by doing thief
things such as stealing. This would encccccourage people to actually play a
THIEF than a fighter that can backstab and outfight a W/W.

Those are very reasonable modifications that could be made, and would make the
T/T class a bit more distinguishable from the warriors.

Thanks for reading,

Text
Here's my spill on the code before I delete all my characters, even though I know it won't make a dent
I have been mudding now for almost 8 years, and I have been on several muds and have enjoyed myself
When I found this one, I said to myself, "Hey, a new challenge and a bit easier"
however, when the Pk started I was hesitant about ever playing again
like I said, this won't make a dent in your decisions, but I just wanted to say something
of the few, FEW, muds I played where PK was allowed, very few people used it, if any.
and on those rare times, it was usually to knock off an abnoxious player
however, making it total pk is crazy, that takes the fun out of a game.
sure the fact that you can do PK in D&D and White WOlf, etc, but there it's structured
I left my old mud and joined this one because it gave me something new and fun to play with, now it's going to turn into an utter bloodbath
which I don't think many players will enjoy, in fact several will probably leave as it is.
for those times when the IMMs have been on, I'm sure you've noticed how many players are not there.
granted I am a "newbie" but I still don't believe that this is a total fair thing.
I'm not going to close myself to the game at all, and would discuss it with
any Imm who wishes to get some feedback.  But at this time I don't think I can play anymore.
whether it matters to you or not, I have said my spill.

Heya all, got some ideas for changes, some are NECESSARY to do
1.)let all players, flagged or not be able to buy in shops
2) make it visible to all that someone has a flag somehow on who list and their long desc before name
3) put clan halls in for the 3 clans, screw castle code cause it's too high
errr too large rather.
4)fix the exp loss thing, losing 100 exp for a death is 1 thing, but a guy lost 10k today and quit, *queer*
5)keep pkill optional for all players who decide to be, plus clan members, joining a clan automatically makes you pkill
6)clean up the remort code a touch so people have not only incentive but reason and necessity to reclass
7) make it so stealthed players names are still displayed on public channels even if stealthed. this way people know who's talking, who may be on and it avoids 10 someone's all talking.

these are just some ideas but I'm sure many if not all players will agree with them.
Listen to me and ToC can be saved!

I don't entirley understand why thieves have a huge advantage on an all pkill ToC, other than
the fact that they make good pkillers... but they did before.  Anyway, an idea to make them less
powerful as pkillers is to take away their ability to use stealth and weaken their backstab
when they have a pkill flag.  There's lots of excuses you could use, like... the people
(mobs and players) are more cautious and they recogize your face better because they've
seen your face a lot on wanted signs.

well that don't seem to make any sense. Stealth does come off when you attack someone.
Stealth cannot go back on after a fight (if it's a pfight) because of battle ticks.
If it automatically came back on after every fight you'd never be able to move.

Duh, easy solution.  Make the mud keep track of how many players you've killed (I believe it does that already?) and make it so that you're only lootable to the number of players you've killed, +2...  Because realistically, you can't make it so th

This mud was very fun the way it was when I first started playing. It seems like most of the new codes being put in have hindered the gameplay.
This is still a fun game, but now there doesn't seem to be a reason to level above the pk line with players like Tyrant.

We must realize that not everyone is going to be nice about this...  Not everyone is going to play fair
and not attack vastly weaker chars.  I propose an addition to the formerly postulated idea about the looting.
My idea is this:  Do the same thing with exp.  If a person attacks a char more than 5 level below him, 
his exp gain is proportional to the number of PK's the lower char has.


any thoughts welcome...

All I been hearin fer days in 'oh I don't want to pkill, I want to be nice and friendly' and crap like 'I'm not gonna play here cause of this pkilling'.
Well TheRock, you took the name of a WWF superstar and I will quote that same superstar by saying "This guy ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!"
You think that your incessent whining is gonna make the situation better? My guess is it's gonna make your more likely to be victimized.
Here's a news flash for ya: ToC has been around many years and has had many changes, some bad, some good...but it's still continued
even with whiny ass players like you newbies. So quit yer cryin cause the world will go on, with or without you.
You should be glad they instituted it. Instead of being the sucky ass, waste of time players you'd become under non pkill conditions, now you'll have to actually think and not suck!
Way I see it, the administrators did us all a favor by adding some life to this place...I haven't seen this many people on in a long time.
My advice to you is simple. Pkilling is in, you are here, deal with it. It's really really fun to do with some practice.
Eq can be replaced and lost experience can be regained. Fighting another person is much more fun than fighting a lifeless mob that stands there waiting to be killed. Where's the challenge?
I've even gone from being a jerk to everybody to just being a jerk to some people and helping those who don't whine to learn, get better eq and find out some good tips.

Well, it seems like the people with alot of hp like the new pk thing and the ones who don't dislike it.  I guess that's to be expected, it's elitism at it's finest (or worst).  It's not really a favor to have pk since some people just like to kill

Text
I was just wondering if anything can be done about the amount of exp lost with pk.
I lost 10000 for dying.  Pk isn't really a bad thing except for losing exp.  That was the only thing about it that pissed me off.  If anything can be done, I'm sure everyone would appreciate it alot.  Thanks.

Subject one more suggestion for pkill~
Text
This is just a suggestion to deal with the problem of pussies getting to 
level 30ish and then never leveling again, and then killing newbies that 
don't know any better.  Any idiot could do this and rack up
a mountain of pkills.  I propose that you add something to the pkill code
so that if you stay at the same level for 10 hours (or whatever number)
that you can't pkill again until you level.  Up till level 50 anyway, after level 49 you wouldn't
be forced to level to keep pkilling.  Just an idea.

toss their psi code and put +2 bonus to gains on hp/mana each level for reclasses characters?
have lonely and mines restored by one of the imms

Already fixed this problem by making WANTED people attackable by *all* levels.
So a lvl 54 can just smack that 30ish char now once they're wanted.

That should eliminate most of the problem, if not, I'll change it some more.

My alignment will not move past 1 even when I am killing evil mobs. I have no idea what is going on.
If you could see if there is something going on it would make the character playable.
Also, Thanks for putting this up. Has been fun playing it. 

You could also look into taking the flee component off fists of fury or up the damage of blinding fist. :)

Text
The final remort (to get to 59) does not appear to have any of
the previous benefits of the prior remorts.
Each remort seems to build on the next. i.e. No hunger/thirst, and then no
hunger/thirst with psionics, etc.

In the climb to 59, is it seemingly a normal run. No safe from hunger, no psionics, etc.
The thing that works for all remorts is flat bonus when you're at level 3 to hp/mana/move.
