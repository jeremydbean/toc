                     The Illisandian Family History

     The Illisandian Family was started by Zarith who changed his family
name to Illisandian after leaving his homeland east of the Dragon Sea.
Zarith left home at age 17 by buying passage on a ship that was to be the
first to ever cross the Dragon Sea.  Nobody in Zarith's homeland, including
his own family, ever expected to see the ship again.
     Zarith somehow made it safely across the sea though.  The tattered
remains of Zarith's personal journal tell of how the ship he crossed on was
attacked by a gigantic sea creature who attacked the ship to grab a mage
that was onboard.  Zarith managed to escape the jaws of the sinking ship
and arrived on the shores that make up the western border of the sea.
     Zarith was ever thankful to the Gods that saved his life so he
vowed to lay stake to this land and build upon it a great home and shrine
for the newly founded family he wanted to create under the name Illisandian.
Zarith headed west and fell upon the small civilization that was founding a
new city that was to be called 'Midgaard'

        at the fortress so I've not the time to carry out this order
        so I am leaving it up to you to take a quarter of the garrison
        with you to the campus to escort young master Zorac from there
        to to here.  Once he has arrived you are to speak with the
        Knight of the Battleground and he shall open the doors to the
        the Battleground so young Zorac may visit his father.  Do not
        fail me in this, I rarely pass on orders to you and if you are
        unsuccesful in protecting the young master than I will deal
        with you personally.

You notice the order is signed by Korzath's Guardian and dated last week.

                       **********************
		       *-=-=-=-=Memo=-=-=-=-*
		       **********************
			  From the desk of
			   Master Korzath

     My loyal Engineers:

	The work and effort that you have put into advancing our
    manufacturing equipment has been most exquisite.  The progress that
    we have made in the past months has put us way ahead of schedule.
        However, I must ask that you work to double your efforts over
    the next few days.  As you already know, some important guests are
    arriving from places all over Sembia.  IMPORTANT guests because
    they might possibly decide to invest in the cause.  Their decison
    will be based on what they see here during their visit.
	The funding that these powerful members of society could offer
    us could quite possibly finance further expansion of our facilities
    and I don't have to tell you that we could use more space!  If we
    can expand our fortress I estimate that we could be ready to launch
    the final phase of our cause within the next three months!  Needless
    to say, these guests are important to me and if we don't recieve the
    support from them that I desire then I will be forced to hold your
    department personally responsible since it is your duty to oversee
    the manufacturing facilities.

                            Project Starlight
                            -----------------
                       Funded by Korzath Industries

Project Description:
====================

  The idea behind Project Starlight is to use a combination of magic and
mathmatical theory to create a new type of portal.  Current portals allow
us to enter them and travel long distances within our own world.  The goal
of Project Starlight is to create a new portal type that will allow us to
break a hole through time and space, a hole that will allow us to travel
to different points in time and possibly alternate realities that are
similar to our own existing world.

Entrance to the Fortress~
     You stand before the entrance to Korzath's mighty fortress.  The
fortress is built into the lower side of the mountain here.  The entrance
leads from the mountain path up into a hallway leading to the foyer.
     Korzath built this fortress as his new residence right after he sold
a large chunk of land to the Sultan many years ago.  New Thalos now stands
on that plot of land and some say it was Korzath's biggest mistake to not
have used his inherited fortune to build his own city there.  Maybe you
will find an answer inside as to why he invested his money into this fortress
instead of into building cities.  You notice an upturned rock on the path
that you might want to look at.

Inside Korzath's Private Fortress~
     The paved path leading to the fortress stops at the entrance to the
hallway that you now stand in.  High above, you can see the stalagmites
that make up the ceiling.  The walls to the left and right of you are
covered in painted hieroglyphics that are impossible for you to interpret.
A translation plaque is imbedded into the floor for you to look at.

     The new city grew quickly.  Every new city needs blacksmiths and Zarith
used his skills to become the first blacksmith of Midgaard.  As time passed
Zarith grew quite wealthy and officially purchased the plot of land next to
The Dragon Sea.  He later met a young woman named Inia and married her.  They
started their family in Midgaard and the gold continued to pour into Zarith's
business.  Zarith invested the money into building Market Road in Midgaard
and he rented out all of the shops along it to make even more money.  His
investments into shops continued in other towns around the area including
Ofcol, Rome, the Gnome Village, and Old Thalos.
     As Zarith grew older he took sick and could no longer maintain his
business.  He passed the business onto the oldest of his two sons just
three months before making his wife a widow.  His oldest son, Markaroth
had his father's business smarts while the youngest son, Fyzac, had his
ancestors military genius and combat abilities.  Markaroth built his father's
business into a small empire extending all over the growing land of Sembia.
Fyzac on the other hand chose a darker path.  He took the destructive
instincts of his ancestors and raised an army against Midgaard that was
quickly put down by it's inhabitants.

     Fyzac was outcasted from the town and left to live in his home in the
mountains.  Fyzac married a woman named Kylee.  Kylee had been outcasted
from Ofcol when she was convicted of being a witch.  Kylee bore Fyzac one 
son who they named Korzath.  They raised Korzath in their mountain home
and trained him well in the ways of fighting and spellcasting.  When Korzath
came of age he travelled out to the towns of Sembia and fought in prize
fights.  Korzath never lost a single bout and thus established a respected
reputation.  His uncle Markaroth, who was now stuggling to keep the family
business number one, took Korzath under his wing to teach him the ways of
running the business.  With Korzath's reputation behind the business it
soared to new heights and the family fortune grew tenfold.  When Markaroth
mysteriously disappeared, the business was turned over to Korzath.
     Markaroth's will asked that Korzath take the family fortune and carry
out Zarith's dream of a fabulous home off the coast of The Dragon Sea.
Instead, Korzath ignored the request and sold the land to the Sultan for
a great sum of money.  He then sold off each piece of the business and
used a large chunk of the family fortune to construct this family fortress.
Korzath then withdrew from all of society to live in this fortress on the
mountain where he was raised.

Grand Foyer~
     The Grand Foyer is made up of dark rock walls and three passages
leading deeper into the fortress.  A remarkable crystal statue stands in
the center of the foyer.  Light from the torches bounces off of the
prismatic statue sending glorious rainbow colors in various directions
illuminating the foyer.

     From the looks of this door it seems you might be nearing the barracks
where Korzath's small fortress militia is housed.  Korzath's family made
it's fortune manufacturing weapons back in the days when Midgaard still
stood.  You vaguely wonder if their weapon technology has kept up as the
years have gone by.

the reason Korzath must keep this place so secretive is because he must
be getting ready to try and take over the entire weapon and armor industry
by mass producing his products and most likely sell at such low prices
that he'll drive the local town smiths out of business.  Somebody needs
to put a stop to this.

     It is suprising that these engineers would know how to develop the
machinery technology in the first place.  They may know how to prepare
it but you seriously doubt they could have devised such advanced principles
on their own considering only a mere quarter of the technology they have
here has ever been created anywhere else in the world.  To the north is a

Metal
-----
Titanium

Discovered
----------
Discovered as a direct result of Project Starlight.

Uses
----
Main use of the titanium alloy is for use in the making of arm plates,
bracers, and belts.  Other uses are for weapons although we have discovered
that when used as the main metal compound of a weapon it is difficult to
wield thus it is more difficult to hit and opponent but the damage per hit
has been increased by using titanium.

Additional Data
---------------
The titanium alloy tends to be extremly lightweigh when compared to platinum.

Metalworks~
     Anvils are grounded into the floor here.  Blacksmiths stand over the
anvils pounding away at their work.  Each blacksmith is working on making
something different.  Some are using the refined sheets the machinery
workers sent in to make armor and weapons while some of the other blacksmiths
are shaping the spare components that will be put into the machinery used in
the fortress.

     This corner of the metalworks facility seems strange.  There is an anvil
here but no blacksmiths are using this particular one.  Bins full of finished
products are stored here as well.  Each is covered with a tight tarpaulin
so it is impossible to steal it's contents.

     Metalurgists are busy pouring large cauldrons of molten liquid into
molds bolted into the ground.  Most of them are to make whole sheets of

resembles the Saint of travelling.  If only you could remember that Saints
name.

Checkpoint~
     Korzath's secret guard protect this checkpoint.  Not many secrets have
been kept from you thus far but the buck stops here as far as Korzath is
concerned.  A plaque is mounted on the door behind the guards for all to see.
     "Absolutely NO unathorized personnel allowed past this point by order
of Korzath himself," the guard reports.
     "Check the guest list," you reply.
     The other guard snickers, "If you be a guest than me be a drunk pirate."

     Well, now you've done it.  You've broken past the Starlight guards and
now stand in the entrance to Project Starlight itself.  More guards rush
from the east and west to stop you.  Beyond the guards are three hallways.
Each hallway is emitting a brilliant and beautiful white light.  What could
possibly be in there?

Project Uses:
=============

  By being able to travel between dimensions we will be able to discover
new technologies to help us with the Cause.  Our number one hope is that
we will discover new weapons technologies as well as new types of metals
for use in the armor equipment we manufacture.
  We expect to encounter hostile entities in these other dimensions,
entities that will either be impossible to control or will abide us in
our quest for knowledge.  Master Korzath has decided that each time a new
portal is created that we shall send our secert guards through to scout
the new dimension.  The secret guards will work to capture any new beings
they fall upon.  Master Korzath hopes to build a new army for the cause,
an army of creatures from other worlds!  The secret guards will escort
all captured creatures to the Battleground Arena in the heart of the
fortress where they will test their abilities against other captured
creatures.  The strong that survive will be placed under a permanent
charm spell and then trained to serve in the Army of the Cause.
                                                Continued on 3page

Project Dangers:
================

  When opening portals to other dimensions there is a chance that the
beings on the other side of the portal will too powerful for us to
capture.  In the event that they are impossible to capture and charm
the portal is to be closed IMMEDIATELY.  We cannot risk the chance of
a creature coming through the portal and damaging our fortress.  This
would spell disaster for our Cause.
  If we are successful in opening a portal to another dimension we fear
we may damage the time continuum in the dimension we open the portal to.
Anyone travelling through a Project Starlight portal will have to be
careful not to touch the swirling black vorticies that represent the edge
of the continuum.

     Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.  This room contains nothing except
for many symbols drawn on the floor and walls but, most importantly it
contains five mages who are each kneeling on one of the five symbols on
the floor.  They all turn in unison and stand as they are startled to see
intruders in their domain.  The blasting white light you saw before must
be coming from the room to the north of them.

Ofcol~
     As you recover from traveling through the portal you take a moment to
look at your surroundings.  You recognize this place right off the bat.

It's Ofcol!

    Or maybe not.  Something doesn't seem right about this Ofcol.  Instead
of it being the secure city you are used to it is a city in dire straights.
The road is ravaged with garbage and stained with blood.  Massive battles
must have taken place but by who?  Where in Sembia has this portal taken
you?  Toto, I don't think we're in Sembia anymore.

theory?  You stop daydreaming to fight the oncoming mech.
