in the process. After the rebellion he named Peter Robes, a former scientist,
president and let him form a 'democratic' council. Robes was an easy prey for
Abdiel's mental powers.

blood bloodsword saber~
   The bloodsword is a weapon made by and for the Blood Royals. It's a
Light Saber that can be used to attack or to form a shield ... however, when
you wield the Saber, tiny needles will protrude from its hilt, injecting micro-
machines that will find their way through your neuro-system and establish a
link between your brain functions and the Saber. Some guardians were even able
to create a mindlink with each other through the bloodsword. However only the
Blood Royals can survive the micro-machines, through their manipulated genes...
common mortals will die an agonizing death as a result of a corrupted nervous
system. Use of the Saber reduces your mental stamina, until ultimately one is
totally drained of one's mental energy ...

   As soon as you hold the hilt of the bloodsword in your hand, your hand
begins to sting painfully and a flaming energy blade appears. Then, by a mere
thought from you, the bloodsword switches to its defensive mode and the blade
is replaced by a wavering energy shield.

			    THE GLITTER PALACE
			    ------------------

		     ( Star of the Guardians Trilogy )

		  a Morgan production, (c) September 1994
			new format in November 1994

The Glitter Palace consists of 5 levels and is meant for players from level 10
till 50. Open your eyes, look at room descriptions for clues and try look at
things, use your brain and you'll find what you're looking for ... ignore
advice in room descriptions at own risk and ohh ... i almost forgot : there
may be hidden doors without any hints, these will only be shortcuts, so
missing these won't matter much.
e.g. what's it, you usually open when you want to go down (or up) ??
Ask yourself questions like these, find the places where you must use that
knowledge and beat "the Glitter Palace" !!!!!!!!!!
p.s.  looking at equipment might give you a clue as to what it will do.
p.p.s.you might also be able to open doors with e.g. either: open e, or open
      east, open w, or open west, etc.
3p.s  have lots of fun while working your way up !

entered the throne room, they were trapped without their bloodswords and up

The Throne.~
     King Amodius Starfire sits on his throne, then you notice the gaping
wound on his forehead. A mortally wounded guardian manages to whisper in your
ear : 'The king has died ... long live the king !!', his last act is to raise
his hand and point towards the throne. A sad thought crosses your mind ...
many called the old king a doddering fool ... even amongst the guardians, yet
they gave their lives to try to safe him ... after all, he was their king.

screen1~

The symbols turn into words and then finally in sentences and you are able to
read the story of Platus, one of the Guardians of the famous golden wing ...

     As you know, the golden wing consisted of the four Lords Sagan,
Platus, Stavros, Tusca and the Lady Maigrey ... Once the famous elite
guardians of King Amodius ... now one of them has betrayed his king ...
revealing the one flaw in the genetically-manipulated born leaders, the Blood
Royal ... their ability to lead, creating an almost insatiable lust for
power.
     And so it came to be that the leader of the golden wing, Lord Sagan,
conspired with the evil Abdiel, to take over the power from King Amodius ...
The almost senile and incompetent ruler of this universe. Still the other four
Guardians remained loyal to their liege ... something Warlord Sagan, as their
wing leader, saw as betrayal towards him.
     The last four Guardians were unable to save Princess Semele or Prince
Augustus, but did manage to escape with their new-born baby, the new Crown
Prince Dion Starfire. Since then they each went their way, entrusting Lord
Platus with the care for the child, since he had always been the wisest.
~
E
screen2~

     Alas, they were not safe for long since their former comrade in arms and
leader, Warlord Sagan, now hunted them and killed them one by one. Dion even
witnessed the death of his 'father' and tutor Platus.
     On the other end of the universe Lady Maigrey felt the death of Platus
by the mind-link induced by their Bloodswords. But now the mind-link was
re-established, Lord Sagan was also able to feel her presence and position
in the galaxy. Now Lady Maigrey was a prisoner/guest of Sagan.
     Just before his death Platus had entrusted Mendaharin Tusca, son of
Lord Tusca, with the care for the young Dion. Still ... Dion's Blood-Royal
genes drew him to Lord Sagan, and the chance of becoming the new king. And
so Dion also became a prisoner of Sagan. Lord Sagan put Dion through a test
ritual that would prove whether or not he was destined to be king. Dion passed
the test, still Sagan was reluctant to believe ... - Impatient as you are,
you scroll down the text until you see the name of Platus mentioned again -...

Now is the time of the assault of Warlord Sagan's regular troops and Abdiel's
mind-deads on the palace. Now is the time where the baby Dion has to be saved.
Now is the time that the ghost of Platus returns to guard the baby.

- The Test,

  And then, i said, we must try them with enchantments - that is the sort of
  test - and see what will be their behavior; like those who take colts amid
  noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature, so must we take our
  youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them into pleasures, and
  prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace. ... And he
  who at every age, as a boy and youth and in mature life, has come out the
  trial victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the
  State. ... But him who fails, we must reject.

Princess Semele's Royal bedroom.~
     You see Princess Semele lying in the bed. A few nurses are tending
to her. Some pages are removing an old set of blankets. Others are bringing
fruits and some soft drinks to Semele. On one side of the bed you see an
empty crib. On the other side, a female Blood Royal guards her queen.

... Sors immanis et inanis, rota tu volubilis ...
... Dread destiny and empty fate, an ever-turning wheel ...

					       Carl Orff - Carmina Burana

crib~

You take a closer look at the empty crib and see that it has been used.
A name has been beautifully engraved in the crib ... it says : 'Dion'.

the Royal Chambers.~
You try to block them out, but the odd words penetrate your mental
barrier with ease:

... the lion does not defend himself against traps, and the fox does not
    defend himself against wolves ...

					       N. Machiavelli - the Prince

To the north you see Prince Augustus' quarters, to the south you see some
ebony doors with the royal crest on them, leading to King Amodius' living
quarters.

King Amodius' Royal bedroom.~
     You notice how common the furniture and decorations are compared to the
rest of the palace. King Amodius might have been a bit indecisive, and maybe
even a fool ... still he had always understood and respected the common man.
Something that can't be said of all rich and/or powerful people.

... Quod per sortem sternit fortem, necum omnes flagite ! ...
... And since by fate the strong are overthrown, weep ye all with me !

Prince Augustus' bedroom.~
The ancient words can't be stopped and resound in your mind:

... nimis exalatus rex sedet in veritce - caveat ruinam ! ...
... raised to dizzy heights of power, the king sits in majesty - but
    let him beware his downfall ! ...

					       Carl Orff - Carmina Burana

Prince Augustus' bedroom.~
     This part of the prince's bedroom is made into some sort of study. To
the north, east and south are large bookshelves filled with all sorts of
books. After a closer look you see that the northern shelf contains some
fantasy and fiction books, the eastern shelf contains some philosophical
books and the south wall is filled with social and economical books.

philosophical philosophy~

You see books from famous authors like ehh ... hmm ... Freud and stuff.
~
E
social sociology~

A quick look shows you titles about social behaviour, all kind of societal
problems etc.
~
E
economy economical~

Names of many economical brains cloud your view .... Porter, Keynes, Abell,
Limperg etc etc. ...
~
E
fiction fantasy~

You take one of them out of the shelf, sit down, and begin to read Tolkien's
Lord of the Rings ... after you've finished it you take another look at the
shelf. A lot of authors are there : Margeret Weiss and Tracy Hickman, Terry
Brooks, Jack Vance etc...etc... You just want to turn your head away when you
see a book sticking out a bit ... It's volume one of the Star of the Guardian
series, The Lost King.

An ante-room.~
     You tried to pull the book out to read it, instead you found out it was
a secret handle that made the entire northern wall swing ajar. You worked
your way in here and found the secret royal elevator. You wonder if it's still
operative. The elevator doors are to the east.
