several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis. The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage. The large booths along the
wall are filled with people drinking and having a grand time. You feel like

Inside the Eastern Gate of New Thalos~
Two large stone towers embedded in the wall loom over you. The massive
iron gate, emblazened with the crest of New Thalos, swings easily on
four ornately crafted hinges. It is obvious the makers of this city spared no
expense in protecting their home.  Main street heads towards the market
westward and the wilderness beckons from the east. To the north lies the
entrance to the mages' guild.

The Hay Loft~
Not as big as the ones you see on farms in the country, this hay loft
serves as a storage area for the horses in the stables. The young boy
you saw with the shovel seems to have taken up residence on the second
story.

The Grand Entrance~
Nowhere have you seen such an obscene display of wealth than in this
corridor. The shag carpeting under your feet makes it seem as if you are
walking on a cloud. Platinum candelabras hang delicately from the ceiling
casting light on the ancient tapestries adorning the walls. The crick
in your neck tells you it's time to stop staring. To the west the
numerous halls of the palace begin and the gate lies to the east.

Ishtar River~
The river flows out from the city down a long winding gully towards
the Sea of Dragons. To the south of you lies the great eastern desert
and north a wide open expanse of grass. You can just barely make out
a road that seems to be traveling alongside the river but the banks are
too steep for you to see very far.

A Split in the River~
The waters of the river crash down upon a rock and split into
two bodies of water. The river you are on continues its southern
course and the new river heads off to the east. To the west you notice
a flat area in the sheer rock where it would be possible to shore your
craft. The River of Lost Souls also continues to the north.

The people of New Thalos take great pride in the services their
city may provide. One of these services is the construction crews
that go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order. Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher than other cities in the realm,
most of the money is used for the good of the people.
