     You NEVER pictured cupid like this.  He's smoking on a cigarette and
needs a shave desperately, and the diaper might look better on him if it
wasn't for his 'lack of excercise'.  He catches you looking at him and
grumbling he shoots you with an arrow.  Looking around he spots a mule and
then he shoots it and begins to laugh as he skips away, but you're not
worried about that right now.  That mule is FAR too attractive.

The statue has in one hand a staff made of gold with a silvery design on
it. In his  other hand he has an ancient blade of which is little
known these days but is said to be of the mightiest swords ever created.
As clothes he uses a non-descript white robe.
It was said that in the old days when the Noldo where the mightiest of
all elves, that Elrond was one of the leaders. He was even family of
Feanor but much lore has since been lost in the battles against evil.

Day of Freedom, 18th the Month of the Ancient Darkness
How long I stayed lost in these dark woods I can't truthfully say.
On the word of the bartender at The Bloody Axe I ventured into the
dark woods of Miden'nir to find the lost city of Midgaard
Having grown up after the flight of dragons leveled the city
Midgaard was often spoken about by my grandfather while we sat around
the evening fire.  Many nights my dreams took me there to live in its
splendor.  Now here I am wishing I never started on this absurd quest
to find the city of my childhood dreams.

Having had several encounters with the dark horsemen, goblins, and
dragon kin wyvern that infest the area like scum I was tired and
coming close to the end of my endurance. It was late morning and the
sun high above was filtering through the leaves making the shadows dance
on the forest floor.  I had spent the night before cold and hungry.  With
no fire or food.  The monsters would have seen the fire and would have
surely smelled anything I could hunt down and kill for my dinner.
Hungry and tired I stumbled over the hill and into a clearing and
before me spread out in the valley below was Midgaard, City of Dreams.

The northern city gates that once stood open for trade and closed for
protection now lay in a twisted heap.  The walls crumbling away to
forest and decay.  Sounds echoed throughout those empty streets and
I could feel eyes watching my every move.  Several places were burned
and littered with bones from the battles fought to keep the city.
All of those battles were fought in vain!  The once proud temple that
once stood as a bastion of freedom and liberty was in ruins.  Holes
riddled the roof.  The altar inside was covered with blood stains.
Everywhere I looked I saw nothing but decay and death.

Now I sit here.  In the same clearing I walked into this morning.
Fire burning bright because even the scum of these woods wont venture
here.  The shadows of the towers stretching into the night sky and
the cries of the doomed echoing from the ruins.  I can only pray that
we, the citizens of Dresden, do not find our fate in the same lines
as the dead in the city before me.

Day of the Sun, 13th the Month of the Heat

Why I took the job I dont know.  Well, money had a large
part of it.  Spend three quarters of my time getting funds
to go ahead and do whatever I am doing at the time.  When
I heard the wizard was hiring people to collect components for him
I figured why not.  How hard could it be to get an herb?  That coupled
with the fact that I was flat broke prompted me to go and try to get
a job.  Well, I got it.  Go to the Frozen Lands and get blood from an Ice Worm.
Dresden was sweltering in the summer heat and I looked forward
to traveling to the frozen lands to get the blood.  Summer.
How cold could it be?

I should have bought warm clothing before I ever started out.  I
realized that while I was on the edge of the wood staring out over
a flat, snow covered land.  Maybe I had made a mistake, but I had
also made a promise and so I started out from the comfort of the
woods.

Three hours later the woods were far behind me and I could see
a city on a mountain in the distance with a keep sitting higher
on the mountain behind the city.  Although still clouded with haze the
scene evoked within me a sense of awe.  After stumbling through these
frozen lands for hours and weeks away from the nearest other town of
any considerable size I looked forward to having a day or two to relax
before continuing my search.  I had seen natives.  Yeti's and barbarians
who fled at my passing, but no worm as of yet.  There was a small chance
that somewhere in the city I could find the blood of the worm that the
wizard needed.  Besides that I looked forward to the warmth of fire in
any inn I could find.

Nightfall.  The sky opened up and the stars were shining down like all
of the gods angels watching over the world.  I was less than a mile
from the city gates and stopped and looked into the night sky.  These
are the reasons I decided to live like I do.  The freedom.  The sights
that would take even the oldest of souls and fill them with a childlike
wonder at all around them.

~
E
2.1~
.
The gates of the city were open when I finally got there.  It seemed
strange to me that there were no guards, but who would attack such a
distant place from everywhere.  I walked into the city and down two
or three blocks before I saw the first inhabitants.
MINOTAURS!!  The city was inhabited by minotaurs!  By the names
of Soulcrusher!!  Creatures of legends.  Creatures of dreams and
nightmares.  This explained why there were no guards.  This
explained why the city was built so large.  And as I sat there
looking at them I realized they were looking at me.  When they drew
their weapons is when I found movement again.

Running down the streets I turned around corners and ran through alleys.
Everytime I would turn a corner a new member would join the pursuit.  I
am not sure when they stopped chasing me, but they did.  When I
I first noticed this I stopped and looked back over my shoulder.
When I turned back around the keep towered over me like a behemoth
in the clear sky.  A minotaur was running toward me from the keep
with a huge battle axe ready to swing.  So I did the only thing
that at the time made sense.  I unsheathed my sword and attacked.  If I
was going to die I was going to make sure that they all knew that I
put up a fight.

Actually I won by sheer luck.  I slipped on an ice patch and brought
my sword up while I was on my back.  The minotaur ran right into it
and looked into my eyes even as the life fled from them.

The gates were starting to open wide so I ran over to a cart on the
side of the road and hid.  From the inside of the keep four guards
ran into the night and toward the city with axes and polearms ready.
I leaned against the gigantic wheel of the cart and breathed a sigh of
relief.  Standing up on the balls of my feet and looking into the cart

(this section of text torn and smeared with blood)

~
E
2.2~
I thanked every god in the pantheon.  Before me was part of
an ice worm still warm and with blood in it.  I took the vial the
wizard gave me and filled it as quickly as I could.  It wasn't
quickly enough though and the guards that had ran down to the city
only moments before came running back toward the keep.  I put the top
back on the vial and started running along the side of the keep.
Slipping in some waste along the walls I uttered a curse.  I had
no time to spare with the guards gaining on me rapidly.  I quickly
uttered the prayer of recall.  Closing my eyes to fight the dizziness
and sickness that always accompanied the spell I could feel my
surroundings change.  From the rough feel of the rock to the cool
smoothness of the stone floor of the temple.  I heard laughter and
as I opened my eyes Tifarah, Imbrium, and Sarmini were all laughing.
Not for my safe return, but because of the brown goo the I was
covered with from head to toe.  I was just thankful to be back.

The next day after a restful night at the Inn of the Bloody Axe
I was given wide bearth in the city streets.  The smell wasn't
completely gone.  The wizard took the vial and gave me my gold quickly
shutting the door to his tower in my face.  I was glad it was all
over with.  Whistling a childhood tune that my mother taught me when
I was a young.

If ever I complain of the Dresden summer heat again I will cut my own
tongue out.

I see the fat bastards walking around, cheating the poors of their gold,
I can see their cackles and laughter. . .

crooked teeth showing meat and wine,
so I picked up my blade,
kissed the edge of it, and prayed that today I can get rid of more...
so I stalked the first victim...not too hard...
found him in broad daylight walking around,

didn't suspect that I would slay him, before the others....
second one I found a guard next to... not good, must get away...
down alleyways...found myself in a gutter...
heh heh tomorrow...:)

The small leather bound book looks like it is quite old.  On
the cover is written Diary of a Witch.  When you open the book
you read the following.

The Beginning - Tragedy of a Witch
Long ago and faraway in a kingdom off memorial next to Houston and I-10,
there lived a girl named Featherlight.  Featherlight was a witch, who began
life walking a little on the crooked side.  People mocked her, but she did
not seem to take notice.  Feather did not seem to live up to the expectations
of the populace as a whole.  This bothered some who came in contact with the
witch but not Feather.  To make a life long story of defiance and mockery
short...she was dubbed the Wayward.

It was fear.  Fear that drove them to accuse the small child of witchcraft
(at this time witchcraft was viewed as the equivalent of satanism.)
The child stood in full view of the biast court.  Her eyes round with fear
from the pointing fingers and glances of loathing.

Ignorance often spawns fear, hate, and rejection.  Her own society
rejected the girl.

The stake mocked the girl as she was pushed towards it.  The fire danced in
her eyes, reflected from the torches around her.  She was scared.  So she
prayed, but not to the god she was taught to.  She prayed to her secret
heroine, Medea.  A voice, like the soft sound of rustling leaves, spoke into
the girls mind.

"Use the Power."

The girl saw the lines of power she had ignored before.  She prayed to be
transportated to anywhere else, and seized the lines.

A girl stood, confused, before the altar of some unknown deity.  She was
now Featherlight the Witch, and this was her story.

Featherlight the Wayward Witch

	      Day of the Sun, 34th.

I pull my cloak a little closer around me and finger the bead necklace
that hangs comfortingly around my neck.  I am invisible, but I feel as
if everyone is looking at me.  I slide into the room were my newly killed
corpse lays.  I have seen it one hundred times before, but I cannot get
used to looking at my own self laying dead.  My own eyes are laying open,
blank and lifeless.  I stare nervously at the monster who killed me, he
is looking right through me.


I shiver, despite the warmth of my cloak.  The wand in my hand seems to
be a burden all of sudden.  I am so alone.  The gods except my sacrifice
and reward me.

		   Day of the Bull

I've died again.
Dying is hard on a witch like me...almost has hard as living.

journal you read the following.

Day of the Bull, 1st the Month of the Spring--
It has been several months now since I departed the familiar lands of
Abrevor in search of the unknown. I am still unsure of exactly what it is
that I must find in there strange, foreign lands, but Jhessail was quite clear
in that something of great importance lies here. Despite the thus far futility
of my search, I have found a number of things that greatly disturb me. Not the
least of which being that the Cult of Hargast seems to have allies, possibly
even full members, here. I had believed the Cult destroyed completely in the
years following the Second Darkwar, but mayhap I was wrong. The time may yet
come when I will have to send for other members of the Ten to assist me in
finally crushing the followers of the Mad One.

Day of the Gods, 26th month of the Battle--
Though I grow weary, my quest continues. Everywhere I wander, I find traces
of evil gathering. I have been in combat against trolls, and hellspawn imps
for the past several days. I cannot help but wonder if the ties that bind
Hargast are as strong as I had first thought, if evil still touches the
world so strongly.  These findings have worried me to the point that I have
sent word back to Abrevor for others of the Ten to assist me. I have since
heard rumors that both Brant and Cyrus are moving about in this part of the
world. If nothing else, their company will make my time here more bearable,
as I long to return to the Crystal Tower of my homeland, and all of my
companions.

sky of stars, though they seem much closer then usual.

  surrounding the grove calm and relax you.  From the gentle song of
  a bird to the chirps of squirrels.  The ground is covered in all kinds

could be something you don't want to encounter. This room is filled with
a few chairs and some paintings on the wall. The paintings seem very
non-descript looking.

Carly's Room~
You step into this room and are filled with a sense of well-being.
There is a warm glow of light coming from an unseen source, casting
soft shadows on the walls, revealing lots of bare wood.  One wall
consists entirely of large, built-in, oak bookshelves filled with
books Carly has read many times and still refers to when a particular
passage comes to mind.  In the middle of the room are two large,
overstuffed chairs inviting you to stay and visit awhile.  Her favorite
of the pair is one large enough to fit two people snugly.  Of course
she has pictures of those close to her scattered around the room.  In
the background is the ever present sound of music, low enough to be
unobtrusive, but loud enough to speak to The Soul.

   You are in Drakk's personal chat chamber.  There are a number of very
comfortable sofas about the room and a large oak desk at one end.  There
are some very nice paintings and tapestries adorning the walls.  There
is a very large window on the south wall. The only exits are two oaken
doors to the north and south and the open hole in the floor.

The black trimmed mirror looks hazy as you first look into its depths, but
as you concentrate the form of a very dark castle is apparent.  It

can be seen at its gates.  This must be the fabled Castle Shaded.

Looking through the silver trimmed mirror you see a number of tall birch

a Crimson Lion.  This must be be Berronar Keep home of the Avengers.

You see before you the tremendous shrine built by the King of Summer,
Taliesin.  You immediately become bathed in a bright ray of light which never
seems to end.  The Corinthian columns are ornate and rise to the magnificent
height of 15 meters.  In the back of the shrine, you see an altar with
the Golden Chalice on its top, the very cup from which Christos drank.
People come here to receive healing prayers and learn from Taliesin's
music which would make even the most stoic person cry.  On the floor, you
notice Taliesin's pet wolf, Sundancer, who guards the shrine from
vandalism and defamers, but currently sleeps on his carpet, with a bone in
his mouth, with seemingly no worry in the world.

Kyllaric's Realm~
	Upon entering the room, you are transported to a cave deep
underground to the plutonian realms ruled by Kyllaric.  As you enter, you
notice a bust of Plutarch on a rocky shelf.  His eyes seem to follow your
movements warily.  Oddly, beneath him in the shadows is a ceramic statue of
the Disney character Pluto.  As you look, the tail wags.   A small stream
gurgles down the wall of the cave nearby and collects in a small pool
before flowing out through a crack in the floor.  A large table surrounded
by a few chairs is set near the pool and stairs lead down to the back of
the cave.
	A smokeless fire blazes in a pit in the center of the cave sending
flickering  shadows along the walls of the cave and warming the cave
comfortably.   Niches at the back of the cave contain small pottery jars
with names on them.  As you read them, you notice your own name on one.

lest your soul be found wanting in the balance.

    As you step deeper into the room it changes again.  A table with
a mirror top appears in the middle of the room.  The door morphs
itself into the shape of a rectangle and a diamond shaped button
appears next to it.  A low, foggy haze rolls in covering the floor.
The haze rises and thickens, creating a shimmering effect when you
look at anything in the room.  The final change is a bulletin board

			    Cactus Corruption

    (AP)-Arizona    A local man awoke early yesterday morning
		  to the sound of cackling in his backyard.
		    Police report that the man, who wishes to
		  be known as Eclipse, was robbed of a large
		  cactus growing in his backyard.
		    "I was quite stunned by the whole event,"
		  Eclipse said, "I feel so...violated."
		    Police spotted the two perpetrators driving
		  a VW bug with the stolen cactus strapped to the
		  roof. The two men appear to be in their twenties
		  and police have yet to determine a motive.
		    The criminals evaded the police in a high
		  speed chase after the cactus toppled off of
		  of the car causing the state troopers vehicles
		  to halt.  Their whereabouts are unknown.

    The warm, muted glow of two hooded lamps illuminates this cozy room. Furs
cover the floor, and old, massive, smoothly carved wooden furniture lines the
walls. The furniture consists of a large eating-table, three large reclinging
chairs with footstools, and a high stool and a desk. Two shelf units are also
along the walls, home to bright displayed weapons and a few thick books. On
the far wall is a fireplace, a merry blaze crackling within it. It is
surrounded by an ornately-carved stone mantel depicting armored human knights
riding dragons and competing with elven knights on pegasi. Overhead, the
dragon and pegasi riders motif is repeated on the carved panels of the
ceiling. Brass cloak-hooks project from a human-sized arch of richly polished
wooden panelling just inside the door. The arch-topped panel contains a fold-
down wooden bench, and is carved with a large, complex scene of birds singing
over a pool where a unicorn bends its head to drink.

   As the moon crests the horizon
  Cutting off the Sun's golden glow

Lulls in the trees
And calls
Us in.

The Leaves
Give off cold fire,
They blaze into ash
At the end of the year.

And birds
Coast on the winds,
And wheel to the North
When Autumn ends.

The day grows dark,
The seasons bare,
But we
Await the sun's
Green fire upon
The trees.

The wind
Dives through the days.
By season, by moon
Great Kingdoms arise.

The breath
Of firefly, of bird,
Of trees, of mankind
Fades in a word.

Now Sleep,
Our oldest friend,
Lulls in the trees
And calls

  Before you stands the Guardian of the Moon.  To explore the castle further
you must first defeat this fearsome foe in battle.

Tower of Night~
  You walk through a small doorway, then climb up several flights of
stairs. At the top, you stand upon a high balcony overlooking the
entirety of all the combined realms. A cressant moon rides high in
the skies, and no matter how long you watch, it never moves.  The
lands from this vantage point are always covered in darkness.

  You walk through a small doorway, then climb up several flights of

in orbit over the lands. As you watch, all the Sea's that mar it's

Tower of High Sorcery~
  You walk through a small doorway, then climb up several flights of
stairs. As you walk up each step, a strange glow emminating from above
gets brighter and brighter.  Taking the last few steps with trepedition
in your heart, you see an enormous beast from the netherworld trapped
inside the confines of a magic circle.  The glow suddenly starts to fade
away, and as you look down, you notice that you have scuffed part of the
chalk that made up the circle with your foot.  Oops.  You turn to run,
but find there is no exit from this room.  You turn back to face the beast,
knowing your fate is sealed.

The Sea Cave~
   Descending a long flight of stairs, you finnally emerge at a cave
situated on the shore of some forgoten sea.  Several lounge chairs made
entirely of some luminescent moss rests in just the right spot so
the sunset can be viewed through the cave opening.  The floor of the cave
is covered in fine sand, that just begs to have toes wiggled in it.  A
salty breaze blows through the cave, cooling as it caresses your skin.
Waves roll in softly on the small shore, creating a comforting melody that
sooth's your soul.  Eclipse can often be found here, as he enjoys the sights
and sounds that fill the cave.

Eclipse's Seat of Power.~
  Before you is the largest skull you've ever seen.  It appears to be
made of some form of black rock, obsidian perhaps.  The teeth appear to
form a stairway up to the nose socket, where a throne has been carved
into it.  Seated on the throne is a shadowy figure, outlined in an
aura of darkness.

Soulcrusher's Crypt~
  Shelves line every wall. Upon the shelves are small earthen jars, sealed
with  tanned human  and  demi-human flesh.  In the center of the room is a
raised  dias,  supporting  a  black  gold sarcophagus, in the image of the
destroyer of souls himself,  Soulcrusher.  The black slate floor is mostly
covered by  a  huge  tapestry,  depicting the image of a sinister skeletal
hand crushing a smaller mortal hand.

A place of clouds and stars~
Soft clouds fill the horizon as far as the eye can see, each swirled like a
childs cotton candy.  You can just catch quick reflections of silver off the
clouds silver linings.  Overhead the sky is filled with a millon stars, more
than you can possibly count, shine down with a warm blue light.  A soft bed
of cloud rests near what you think is the center of the room, it looks
amazingly comfortable but seems to repel your attempts at lying down on
it, for it was made for only two special people.  Also hanging silently
in the night sky is a picture of some kind, you can just make out some kind
of writing on its frame. There is also a strange slot in the cloud bed to
one side....

Grotto~
You enter a very large cave that streches as far as the eye can see.
Above your head flutter the wings of un-seen bats.  The high pitched
sound of their sonar is like music echoing off the rocks.  A clear still
pool sits silently in the center of the chamber, its surface smooth as
untouched by wind or time.  Far overhead hang columns of white crystal
beauty, seemingly in defiance of gravity.  They glimmer softly in the
blue glow that eminates from the cavern walls.  This is the resting place
of the Implementor Gravestone, and it was created for a very special
person in his life right now, who just happens to like caves and bats.

Blackbird's Bird Nest~
You are in a medium sized nest. It consists of little twigs,
feathers and leaf. The twigs has been rounded very nice to
a beautiful rand, which allows you to look over. Looking
down, you see a beautiful waterfall. A rainbow with the most
marvelous colors hangs above it. Far to the west you notice
a high tower. Looking to the southwest, you notice a purple
beach. You notice there is a little table in the nest with
a few chairs around the table. A little bed is placed in the
northeastern part of the nest. The blankets are folded over
the bed. In the eastern part is a little cupboard. It contains
a lot of feathers. Probably Blackbird's outfit.

The Cave.~
     The walls are wide apart and the ceiling high giving this cave a lot
of room.  Looking back towards the small pond from where you came from
you see a solid wall of water.  A great magical force is holding the water
back from spilling into the cave.  A bright fire burns in the center and
the smoke is vented through a hole in the ceiling far above.  This is a
great place to come to when you just want to be alone.

Shadizar's Hide-Away~
You have entered into a room filled with exotic perfumes and incense. A
warm feeling fills your body and your aches and sores begin to fade away. You
see several beautiful Janni inviting you over to take a seat on a marvelously
woven carpet. You sit back and a Djinni appears and wafts a cool scented
breeze around the room while an Efreeti arrives warming the room to a suitably
comfortable temperature. Just when you think you will pass out from a total
sensory overload there is more. A very handsome Dao arrives with an extremely
beautiful Marid, to add to your pleasure the Dao begins to create very minute
vibrations in the earth itself acting as a total body massage for your weary
muscles. To add the final touch, the beautiful Marid begins firing jets
of water at the Efreeti which steam up and make the room a very pleasurful<?>
sauna. Now you know why Shadizar is so happy and calm all the time.

The Chapel of Heaven~
The night sky reaches forever, and millions upon millions of stars paint
bright white lights on the velvet backdrop.  Here standing solitary and
silent are a small altar, glowing in a soft blue light.  There is also a
rainbow, streching over the altar, colors swirl in unrecognized patterns
and it fills this special place with a sense of calm and peace and love.
Shooting stars leave glittering trails of white overhead, and a small
dwarf star makes a brief apperance then departs.  White colums reach up
into the sky holding only the darkness at bay.  There is a small glowing
plaque hovering in the night sky close to you...

The Chapel Garden~
 Sheltered on one side by the rear of the chapel and the others by a ring
of stately pines, the garden is secluded and tranquil.  A flagstone path,
lined with candles in ceramic pots, stretches through the lush grass from
the chapel to the far side of the small garden.  On both sides of the path
are rows of delicately carved marble benches, arranged in a semicircle to
face the center of the garden and the raised gazebo there.  The gazebo is at
the center of a circular marble pool, and small spouts send water trickling
softly from the base of the gazebo into the basin.  Tiny white lights have
been inset in the marble, making the water shimmer with each breath of air.
Vividly colored fish dance just beneath the surface of the water.  A gently
arching bridge links the flagstone path with the gazebo, the candles at each
edge reflecting in the water below.  The gazebo is also made of white marble
-- it gleams in the moonlight and in the glow of fairy lights overhead.
Grape vines climb up the four marble columns to overgrow the lattice roof,
creating a living canopy.  The lights are threaded into the grape vines,
twinkling softly in the night breeze.  Above the garden, the sky is deepest
blue velvet with only a sliver of the moon glowing amid the millions of
stars.

Azlyn's Room~
Azlyn's large, airy room is circular, bathed in a steady, soothing light,
though there are no visible light sources.  The soft glow, and the scent
of jasmine and sandalwood which pervades the air, immediatly put you at
peace.  The walls arch in majestic grace, drawing your eyes to the skylights
in the ceiling above you.  Large windows are set into the curving walls,
offering panoramic views of the realms.  On a raised dais in the center
of the room sit Azlyn's matching desk and chair.  They are intricately
carved from white marble and inlaid with silver.  Various items rest on the
desk, including a large, bound book and a silver goblet.  To one side of
the desk rests a simple stand of white marble.  On top of this, a hand with
long, talon-like fingernails holds a glowing ball of faceted crystal.  To
the other side of the desk, a long, sinuous dragon of carved onyx twines its
his way up a slender column of white marble.  On his head rests a basin of
silver, hammered paper thin.  The liquid it holds is dark as night and
perfectly still.  The floor is covered with beautiful, thick rugs, and the
room is strewn with large, inviting pillows.
