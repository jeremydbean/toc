~

0 ALIAS ALIASES~
Syntax:
alias <word> <command as a string>     (sets the alias)
alias delete <alias to delete>         (deletes an alias)
alias <word>                           (shows an alias)

e.g.: alias mm cast 'magic missile'
      alias delete mm

To see all the aliases you have, type alias and to see a specific alias
type: alias <alias name>.

There is a max of 20 aliases per character.
~

0 AREAS~
Syntax: areas

AREAS shows you a list of areas in the game.  Area names are shown with
recommended levels.  However, those recommendations are just a rough range
and it is a good idea to read road signs to determine if you are entering
somewhere that may be particularly dangerous.
~

0 ARRIVE DEPART~
Syntax: arrive <string>
        depart <string>

Sets the message that others see when you enter and leave rooms.

All messages must contain a $n where your name is to be placed and a
$t(or $T) where the direction is to be placed.

The difference between $t and $T is the directions that are defaulted.
$t (arrive/depart)= north, south, east, west, up, down
$T (arrive) = the north, the south, the east, the west, above, below
$T (depart) = the north, the south, the east, the west, up, down
~

0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
Syntax: autolist
        autoloot
        autogold
        autosac
        autoexit
        autosplit
        autoassist

ToC uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The actions are as follows:

autolist   : list all automatic actions
autogold   : take all gold from dead mobiles
autoloot   : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autosac    : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpses)
autoexit   : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit  : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassist : makes you help group members in combat

Typing a command sets the action (except for autolist); typing it again removes
it.  When you create a new character, the default is for all of the automatic
actions to be on.

AUTO is equivalent to autolist and also shows the status of the PROMPT,
COMBINE ITEMS, NOFOLLOW, NOSUMMON, and NOLOOT flags..
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be successful, see the help entries
on the SCROLLS, STAVES, and WANDS skills for more information.  No skill is
required to quaff a potion.
~

5 TEACHLIST~
Syntax: teachlist

This will show you a list of guildmasters and what they can teach you for skills/
spells. Some spells/skills will require that you learn the group they are in.
So also check out the gainlist command.
~

5 GAINLIST~
Syntax: gainlist

This will show you a list of guildmasters and what they will allow you to gain
for skills/spells. For information on every group you can consult the help.
The command teachlist will show you where you can learn which spell. So also
check out the teachlist command.
~

70 DNS~
Syntax: dns

This command will turn DNS lookups on and off.  Remember that with DNS lookups
turned off, sitebans on name hosts will be ignored.

~

67 FSAVE~
Syntax: fsave

This command will force all the players to save, but doesn't send them a message
when you do it.  This command is also invoked on reboots and shutdowns.

~

0 BRIEF~
Syntax: brief

If brief is on, you will see only short descriptions of rooms when you
enter them and when you type LOOK.  Typing brief once, turns brief on; typing
it again, turns it off, allowing you to see full descriptions.

The default is for brief to be off.
~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second.

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 CLIMB~
Syntax: climb <object>

In order to get between certain rooms, you must CLIMB a rope, ladder or
other object.  Read room descriptions carefully to find the object you need
to climb.
~

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

Those with the appropriate skill can PICK locks, enabling them to open
locked doors or objects without having the key.  See help on PICK for more
information.
~

0 COLOR~
Syntax:  color on/off/list/default
         color <color type> <color>

The COLOR command is used to toggle color on or off and to set colors for
the various channels.

Typing the word COLOR alone will toggle color on or off.

COLOR DEFAULT is used to load the default colors for the various
channels.  If you turn color on without having set defaults, you will not
see any colors as they will all be set to grey.

COLOR LIST shows a list of the available colors.

To set the color for an indivdual type of message, use
COLOR <TYPE OF MESSAGE> <# of color>
The color number can be obtained using COLOR LIST.
For example, to make all gossips appear in yellow, type:
COLOR gossips 7
~

0 COMBINE~
Syntax: combine

If combine is on, you will see like items in your inventory combined on
a single line.  The number of items of that type you have will be shown in
parentheses in front of the item.

For example, if, with combine off, you see:
a big pot pie
a big pot pie
a big pot pie

with combine on you would see:
(3) a big pot pie

If combine is on, typing combine again turns it off, showing you the long
inventory again.  The default is for combine to be on.
~

0 COMMANDS~
Syntax: commands

COMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game.
~

0 COMPACT~
Syntax: compact

When COMPACT mode is on, your actions and the game responses are shown to
you without spaces between the lines.  Typing compact once turns compact
mode on; typing it again, removes compact mode, showing blank spaces between
lines again.

The default is for compact to be off.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.  You may
wish to wear, wield or hold an item which compares as worse if it has
bonuses, such as additions to attributes.  These modifiers can be determined
by using the IDENTIFY spell or the LORE skill..
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
When you consider a character, you will see two lines of information.
The first line refers to the relative level of you and the character you
are considering; the second refers to the relative number of hit points
(based on max hp, not current hp).  Between these two you should have a
rough idea of whether or not it is worth attempting the fight.
~

0 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~

0 CREDITS~
Syntax: credits

This command shows the list of the original Diku Mud implementors.
~

0 DELETE~
Syntax: delete <password>

Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed along with your password to
delete a character, and you cannot be forced to delete. Deletion is permanent.
You will not be restored for deleting yourself.
~

0 DESCRIPTION DESC~
Syntax: description <string>
Syntax: description + <string>

Sets your long description to the given string.  If the description string
starts with a '+', the part after the '+' is appended to your current
description, so that you can make multi-line descriptions.
~

0 DONATE~
Syntax: donate <object>

If you have items in your inventory that you no longer need, you may
wish to donate them for the use of other adventurers.  The donate command
allows you to do this even if you are far away from the Temple of Devota.
The donated item will be placed randomly in one of the donation pits -
either in the Temple of Devota or in one of the guild halls in Dresden.
~

0 DRINK EAT FILL~

Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>

0 EMOTE , POSE SOCIAL SOCIALS~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: , <action>
Syntax: pose

Socials are a large set of specialized commands that let you do such things
as smile, wave, etc. to yourself, others or nobody in particular.  For a
complete list of the available actions, type SOCIAL.

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  A shortcut for emote is ,.
EMOTE allows you to perform actions that are not built in.

POSE is a variant of EMOTE.  POSE selects a pose at random.  The poses are
dependent on your class.

The following is a (not necessarily complete) list of the socials which

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).

INVENTORY lists your inventory (i.e. items you are carrying but not currently
using).
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK READ~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look room
Syntax: look <object>
Syntax: look <character>
Syntax: look <direction>
Syntax: look <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.  For example, if you look
at a character, you will see that character's description and equipment.

LOOK alone, without an argument, describes the room you are in; if BRIEF is
on, you will see only the short description of the room.  Use Look room to
see the full ("unbriefed") description of the room.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.

READ is a synonym for LOOK.
~

51 EXCHANGE~

Syntax: exchange

If you are a hero, you may exchange experience for more practices.  The cost
is 5000 experience points.  This means that if you would rather get more
practices rather than another level, exchange the experience before leveling.
Otherwise you'll have to get 5000 more experience up and above your new level.
Exchanging experience for practices gives you 4-6 more; the exact number of
practices you get is random.  You may exchange only at the guru in Hero Hall.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Closed doors are shown
in parentheses.  Not all exits are visible;  room descriptions will generally
provide some clues as to the existence of hidden exits and their names.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

WIMPY will cause you to flee automatically if your hit points drop too low.

See also helps on RESCUE, RECALL and WIMPY.
~

0 FLIP MOVE PULL PUSH TURN~
Syntax: flip <object>
        move <object>
        pull <object>
        push <object>
        turn <object>

Some rooms contain objects which need to be manipulated by flipping, moving,
pushing, pulling or turning them.  Manipulating these objects can have
various effects.  For example, one might push a lever or flip a switch to
open a secret door.  Read room descriptions carefully in order to find
objects that you can manipulate.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP ~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.  To keep yourself from being followed, use the
NOFOLLOW command.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick the <character> out of your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW anyone but you may only GROUP with characters within 8 levels
of yourself.
~

0 GAIN~
Syntax: gain list
        gain <skill or group>
        gain convert

The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has
been found.  The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 10 practices into one training session

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train').

Read the helps on the various spellgroups and skills to determine what
you want to gain.  The helps will show you the minimum level you need to be
to use a skill or the lowest level spell in a spellgroup.
~

0 GROUPS~
Syntax: groups

The GROUPS command shows which spell groups you have (both default and
groups that you have gained).
~

0 HEAL~
Syntax: heal
        heal <spell>

The Temple of Devota and some other locations provide healers for the
assistance of adventurers.  The healer's services are generally free to
players of level 10 or below.  Higher level adventurers may be healed of
their wounds and ills on a fee for service basis.  The HEAL command without
an argument shows a list of the healer's services.  To receive healing, be
sure you have sufficient money and type heal <name of spell>.

For information on the heal spell used by those of the cleric class (and
members of the cleric's guild), read help for HEALSPELL.
~

0 HELP~
Syntax: help
Syntax: help <keyword>

HELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include
all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.  Type HELP INDEX
for an alphabetical listing of all keywords.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.  REMOVE ALL will remove all of your equipment, except for cursed
items.

Those with the appropriate skill may wield a second weapon.  For more
information on this, read help for DUAL WIELD.
~

0 JOIN~
Syntax: join <guildname>

The JOIN command is used to join a guild.  It works only when you are in
Melancholy's treehouse.  The possible guildnames are cleric, mage, thief,
and warrior.  Joining a guild costs 500 coins, which Melancholy will
take automatically when you use the join command.

See also help on GUILDS.
~

0 KILL PKILL MURDER~
Syntax: kill <name of mob>
        murder <character>

The KILL command is used to start a fight with a mobile.  You need to type
kill only once per fight.

PKILL is permanent setting. Once you become level 15, you may choose to
participate in pKilling, and once you have passed level 30, the option is
no longer available.

To do this, you type PKILL and your password.  Once you set yourself to PKILL,
it is permanent, and under no circumstances will it be set back.  You will only
be able to see who pKillers are by physically walking up to them and CONSIDERing
them.

To kill other players, use MURDER.  Player killing is only permitted
for those who have selected this option (SEE ABOVE)  and there are
restrictions on the relative levels of the pkiller and victim.
Non-pKILL players may pkill or be pkilled only in the arena (SEE HELP
ARENA).

MURDER also works to kill mobiles.
~

0 NOFOLLOW  NOFOL~

Syntax: nofollow
        nofol

NOFOLLOW toggles the follow flag, either on or off.

If you have pets you need to get rid of, or people you don't want following
you (i.e. members of a castle with whom you are at war), you can use this
command to prevent them from following you.

In order to be grouped, you must be able to accept followers.

The default for NOFOL is OFF (meaning you can accept followers), and you can
check the status of the NOFOL flag with the AUTO command.
~

0 NOLOOT~

Syntax: noloot

NOLOOT toggles whether or not anyone can mess with your corpse.
There are valid reasons why you might want someone to mess with your corpse:
to retrieve it or to get certain items from it.  If your corpse is set NOLOOT
then it cannot be picked up by, nor can objects be removed by, anyone else.

The default for NOLOOT is on (i.e. your corpse cannot be looted).  You can
check the status of this flag with the AUTO command.
~

0 NOSUMMON~

NOSUMMON toggles whether or not you can be summoned, gated to, or cancelled
by other players.  Read help on SUMMON, GATE and CANCEL for more information
on these spells.  In general, you will want to turn NOSUMMON off only to
permit trusted wizard friends to assist you in transportation and in removing
harmful spells.

The default for NOSUMMON is on (you cannot be summoned, gated to or cancelled).
The status of this flag can be checked with the AUTO command.
~

0 NOTE NOTES~
The following options are available:

reading notes:
note list       : show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
note read       : either by number, or read next to read unread notes
note remove     : removes a note that you wrote or are the target of

writing new notes:
note to         : sets the to line for a new note (name(s), immortal, all,
		  or the castle(s) name)
note subject    : sets the subject for a new note
note +          : adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!)
note -          : deletes the last line you typed (no argument required)
note clear      : erase a note in progress
note show       : shows the note you are working on
note post       : posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note.

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
note read (or just note) to scroll through them one at a time.

You must be at least level 2 to use the note system.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> <command>
Syntax: order all <command>

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).  However,
they will become aggressive again when the charm wears off.  For that reason,
charmed aggressive mobs should not be brought outside the areas they are
normally found in.
~

0 OUTFIT~
Syntax: outfit

The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest),
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be
your old password.  The second argument is your new password.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 1% (unlearned) to a maximum of 75%.  You will continue
to improve in a skill or spell by using it as long as you are not at 1%.
You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will gain
each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you do use them.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: quit
Syntax: save

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds generates a lot of lag.)
You may not save until you are at least level 3.

Some objects, particularly keys, may not be saved.  Objects more than two
levels higher than your current level will also not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere and when you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to the gods for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Devota in Dresden.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not
insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~

0 REMORT~
Syntax: REMORT <passwd> <class> <guild> <race>

REMORT allows level 54+ to start over their career as a new reborn character,
without loosing your character-name. Because of the difficulty of having to
advance again, some rewards are there for the remorted characters. This depends
on the number of times a character has remorted:

Nr of Remorts:    Max Level    Level bonus      Extra Bonus            Title
   1                 55              +1      Freedom Hunger & Thirst   Master
   2                 56              +2         Psionic Powers         Lord
   3                 57              +3       Best Psionic Powers      Emperor
   4                 58              +4     Addl Psionics/Free Recall  Hand
   5                 59              +5      No Encumbrance limits     King

NOTE: A character who remorts loses all the knowledge of his current character.
      You'll start all over, just as you would have created a new character.
      This means you'll lose all spells/skills you currently know. The starting
      hp/mana/end for your character will increase with each remort, and your
      banked and held gold will remain.  On your last remort, you may pick
      any class/guild, and you will keep all items you had at the time.

The extra bonusses are accumulative over the number of remorts. I.e. the
first time you remort, you no longer are affected by hunger or thirst and the
second time you remort, you are guaranteed to be granted psionic abilities at
at level 18, and third time, you are granted the best psionic abilities.  On
your last remort at level 58, you can once again choose any class and guild
and you no longer have any limitations on the number or weight of items you
may carry.

Hero questing at level 50 costs 1000 qps instead of the 500 for the first time.
The class & guild to be selected has to be different as the one you are
currently in. This if you are W/M you can't have these selections on your remort.
Remorting will remember all the classes/guilds you have been in. If you select a
class which has not a guild (i.e. MONK & NECRO) you have to type none as guild.
The Monks have a race restriction of Dwarf & Human.
The Necromancers have a race restriction of Elf & Human.

The classes you can select: mage, cleric, thief, warrior, monk and necro.
The guilds you can select:  mage, cleric, thief, warrior and none (see above).
The races you can select:   human, elf, dwarf, hobbit and saurian.
~

0 ATTRIBUTE AFFECT REPORT SCORE WORTH~
Syntax: affect
Syntax: attributes
Syntax: report
Syntax: score
Syntax: worth

AFFECT shows spells you are currently affected by. When high enough level,
it will show the spell affected by, the duration of the spells affects left,
and the level of the spell cast.

ATTRIBUTE shows a quick list of your attributes of Str, Int, Wis, Dex and
Con in the same format as the SCORE command below.

REPORT shows your current statistics (hit points, mana and movement) to you
and also announces them to other players in the room.

SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only.  Your ability scores
are shown as true value(current value), so for example Str: 15(23) means you
have a 15 strength from training, but a 23 strength from other factors
(spells or equipment).

WORTH shows you a brief summary of your gold and experience points, including
how much experience you need to gain the next level.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE SIT~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: sit

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

For information on the sleep spell, see help SLEEPSPELL.
~

0 RUN~
Syntax: run <direction> <distance>

This command allows you to move through multiple rooms.  Specifying
the distance is optional, and will default to 15 rooms, or until
your run into a wall. Max distance that can be traveled is 25 rooms.
Direction must be specified.
~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to the gods, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.
~

0 SCAN~
Syntax: scan

The SCAN command tells you what mobs are in surrounding rooms.  Only visible
mobs will be shown, unless you are affected by the appropriate detection
spells.  You cannot scan through a closed door.
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

0 SKILLS SPELLS~
Syntax: skills
Syntax: spells

The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.

See also help for GAIN and GROUPS.
~

0 SPLIT~
Syntax: split <amount>

SPLIT splits some gold between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the gold after a kill.  However, this is most conveniently done using
the AUTOSPLIT option.
~

0 TIME WEATHER~
Syntax: time
Syntax: weather

TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.

WEATHER shows the current game weather.

For information about spells that affect the weather, see help WEATHERSPELLS.
~

0 TITLE~
Syntax: title <string>

Sets your title to a given string.

The game supplies a title when your character is created and when you
advance a level.  You can use TITLE to set your title to something else.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer.  Trainers can be found in mud school,
wandering town or in guilds.

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one training session per level.  Training
sessions are also used to buy new skills and practices may be converted to
trains to help you in your studies.  See help on GAIN for more information.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practices when you gain a level and  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
both WIS and CON to their maximum (which depends on your race and class)
before training anything else.
~

0 VISIBLE~
Syntax: visible

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters.
~

0 WHO WHOIS~
Syntax: who
Syntax: who <level-range>
Syntax: who <class or race>
Syntax: who <class or race> <level-range>
Syntax: whois <character>

WHO shows the people currently in the game.  Some people may choose to
remain unseen and won't appear when you use WHO.

WHOIS provides information about a specific player, including their class
and level.  That information may be useful in determining whether to respond
to a request to group or in ascertaining that the person speaking to you is
an immortal and should, therefore, really not be ignored.

WHO without any arguments shows all of the (visible) people currently playing.

With arguments, WHO can show players of certain classes or levels.
For example:

who 10          lists all players of level 10 or above
who 15 20       lists all players between level 15 and 20
who cleric      lists all clerics playing
who immortal    lists all immortals playing
who cleric 1 5  lists all clerics between levels 1 and 5
who elf cleric  lists all elven clerics
who <castle>    lists all members of a specified castle

Classes and races may be abbreviated.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN NORTHEAST NORTHWEST SOUTHEAST SOUTHWEST~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down
Syntax: northeast
Syntax: ne
Syntax: northwest
Syntax: nw
Syntax: southeast
Syntax: se
Syntax: southwest
Syntax: sw

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.  The ordinary directions
are usually abbreviated as N, S, E, W, U and D.   The diagonal directions
may be abbreviated as NE, NW, SE and SW.  If you are using a mud client to
access the game, you may need to alter some of the files to allow for the
abbreviated directions.
~

0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands are essentially an artifact of mud history.  They still
exist and record a lot of bugs, ideas and typos to the implementors, but
it is preferable to use the bug and idea note forums.  See help NOTE for
more information.
~

0 GOSSIP . INFO LEVELING MUSIC Q/A SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: gossip <message>
Syntax: gossip
Syntax: info
Syntax: music <message>
Syntax: music
Syntax: question <message>
Syntax: question
Syntax: shout <message>
Syntax: yell <message>

ToC supplies a number of public communication channels.  Type the name of
a channel with a message to use on of these channels.  Typing the name of
the channel alone turns that channel off.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.  In addition,
players must be at least level 3 in order to shout.

GOSSIP is a variant of SHOUT (without the delay).  '.' is a synonym
for GOSSIP.  GOSSIP is the most frequently used public channel on ToC.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

In general, most public communication between players will be on the gossip
channel.  The Q/A  (Syntax: question) channel is used for asking questions
about items.  Use the MUSIC channel when you wish to sing.
If what you have to say is primarily of interest only to one other player,
you might want to use a private channel (e.g. TELL) instead.
Note that you must be at least level 2 to use the public channels.

The INFO channel displays automatic messages when a player attains a new
level.  The LEVELING channel is intended for congratulatory messages to
those who level.

Typing a channel name without a message turns that channel off.

See also helps on CHANNELS, CC CGOS GTELL DEAF QUIET REPLY SAY and TELL.
~

0 DEAF QUIET~
Deaf allows you to turn off your shout channel.
Type deaf once to toggle the shout channel off, and again to toggle it
back on.  The shout channel is used to give information to everyone on
the mud, and sometimes its overuse leads to considerable spamming.

Quiet allows you to toggle on/off all channels so all you will hear are
emotes and says.
~

0 GTELL REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message
to all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~

10 CGOS CASTLECHAT CC -~
Syntax: cgos <message>
Syntax: cc <message>

CGOS allows you to send a message to members of all castles.

CC is used to send  message only to members of your castle.  The dash, '-'
is a synonym for CC.

Type a channel name without a message to turn that channel off.
~

51 HERO =~
Syntax: hero <message>

A channel is provided for heros to communicate with one another.  This is
similar to the other public channels, like gossip, etc. The equals sign,
'=' is a synonym for hero.

Immortals may also use the hero channel.
~

0 CHANNELS~
Syntax: channels

The CHANNELS command is used to tell you the status (on or off) of all of
your communications channels, e.g. gossip, shouts, info, etc..

To toggle the on/off status of a channel, type the name of that channel.

63 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your possession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~

69 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

70 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

67 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
        ban     <site>
        ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.
~

65 GATHER~
Syntax: GATHER <object name>
        gather <object name> <character>
        gather <object vnum>

***WARNING***
This command is very powerful.  Upmost discretion must be taken
in its use.

The command will gather all items in the game that match the object
fields name. Example:

gather sword

This will gather all items that have the word 'sword' in the
'name' field of the object.

This command should only be used to gather quest items that are
no longer in use, or objects that are suspected of being a bug
in the game.

The second form of the gather command, with a character's name as the
argument, will gather all of the objects that match the name from that
specific character.

The third version will gather all objects that have a corresponding
vnum.
~

69 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
        shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

Never, ever, shutdown the mud without consulting Eclipse, Gravestone or
Soulcrusher.
~

66 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
        newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ToC Mud.  Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 62), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the implementors.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

67 DENY UNDENY~
Syntax: deny <name>
        undeny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  Use the undeny command to allow to character to play again.

~

67 DISCONNECT DUMP~
Syntax: dump <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

64 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

63 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 67 force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

68 MAXLOAD~
Syntax: maxload set <vnum> <amount>
        maxload list
        maxload pla <vnum>

MAXLOAD sets, lists the amount of objects the game should load depending on
vnum. Maxload set & Maxload pla are level 70 commands, while Maxload list
can be done at 68.

In case of maxload set you have options for amount:
-1        -> remove the maxload
0..number -> add the maxload

Remember to check, because if the maxload is lower as the sum of in_game
and with the players, the item will not load anymore, until enough items
got extracted so that the sum of the items with the players and in the game
is LESS as the maxload value specified. Which can take a while....
~

63 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
        sockets <name>
        sockets ip <ip address>

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in
merc.h:

PLAYING                      0
GET_NAME                     1
GET_OLD_PASSWORD             2
CONFIRM_NEW_NAME             3
GET_NEW_PASSWORD             4
CONFIRM_NEW_PASSWORD         5
GET_NEW_RACE                 6
GET_NEW_SEX                  7
GET_NEW_CLASS                8
GET_ALIGNMENT                9
DEFAULT_CHOICE              10
GEN_GROUPS                  11

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).

You can also use the IP argument to list only the players from a certain site.
Example:  socket ip nowhere.com

65 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
        load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried.  Otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

67 SLOOKUP~
This command will show the slot number, and skill number used by the
system. It is useful for finding out numbers to use when 'setting'
a potion or scroll, and various other items.
~

66 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
        set obj   <object> <field> <value>
        set room  <number> <field> <value>
        set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
        set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~

64 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
        string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.

For the action_to_room and action_to_char strings.  Use $p for the object
name and $n for the player name if you want those in the message.

DO NOT USE ANY OTHER VARIABLES, DOING SO WILL CAUSE THE MUD TO CRASH.
~

63 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
        noemote   <character>
        noshout   <character>
        notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or notell'ed will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, auction, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

66 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
        pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.
~

66 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
        purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~


66 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
        restore room
        restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

66 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

63 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
        transfer all
        transfer <character> <location>
        transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer.
~

63 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

64 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
        gecho <message>
        pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~

62 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.
~

63 EXPLODE~
Syntax: explode container <container name>
        explode room

This command will scatter mobs in rooms, or items in containers in your
inventory all over the MUD. It's main use is to simplify placing quest
oriented stuff into the game. Item 26 is a generic item with a no_locate
flag on it that can be used as a quest item.
~

62 HOLYLIGHT WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
        wizinvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can only see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 70 characters are totally
invisible.
~

65 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of the mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

65 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
        vnum <obj or mob> <name>
        vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

63 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
        stat mob  <name>
        stat obj  <name>
        stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

62 CLOAK~
Syntax: cloak <level>

Cloak will make you invisible to anyone not in the same room with you.  Anyone
is higher level than the level you set your cloak at can see you anywhere though.
~

69 BACKUP~
Syntax: backup
        backup now

This command will perform a backup on all of the pfiles.  Typing backup by itself
will show when the next scheduled backup will take place.

~

69 PSTAT~
Syntax: pstat

Pstat shows you various statistics of all the players connected to the mud.
~

62 MWHERE OWHERE RWHERE GWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>
Syntax: owhere <name>
Syntax: rwhere <string>
Syntax: gwhere

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
Owhere shows you the location of all objects with a particular name.
Gwhere shows you the locations of all the players connected to the mud.

Rwhere shows you the room vnum and name of any room matching any part of
the string that you input.  The rwhere command is not case sensitive.

Example:
rwhere hermit

Hermit's hut                             [  331]
Hermit's Lair                            [ 1589]
The Hermit's Corner                      [ 6373]


~

62 QFLAG~
Syntax: qflag <player>

This command sets a (Quest) flag on players that will keep them from losing
experience or equipment during quests.  Remember to remove the quest flag from
the player after the quest is over.  The flag will automatically be removed when
the player quits otherwise.

~

64 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

62 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: poofout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

66 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
        log   all
        snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell an IMP first.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.  This command should only be
used if a character is suspected of some kind of cheating, or you need to
watch someone do something to find a bug in the game.  In the latter case,
it is a good idea to ask for permission first.  Do not use snoop just to
be nosy.  Make sure you have a reason to use it, because you may be
questioned later about why you snooped someone.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

64 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
        return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

62 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
        immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).
~

62 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands available to you.
~

69 COMPONENT~
Syntax: component

Component command forces the scattering of random components throughout
the world, rather than waiting for the MUD to do it randomly over time.
This was added to restore components after reboots or crashes that wipe
the current components from the world.

(do 'owhere component' to see the current components in the world.)
~

65 EDIT~

67 RESTORECHAR~
Syntax: restorechar <player> <date>

Restores a character's pfile as of the specified date.  Date format is,
for example, Jun.1.  Restorechar is intended for use in restoring characters
with bad pfiles, not those who have deleted themselves.

This is to be used only as a last resort for players that have
consistently abused their note privilege.
