The Stage~
This is the stage which overlooks the entire auditorium.  The stage is
about three to four feet off the main floor.  Drab brown curtains frame
the outside of the stage, giving it a stage-like appearance.  Huge cords
and pulleys swing overhead, obviously used for special effects for the non
magically active.  The floor is made of sturdy wooden planks.  Backstage,
you can see several props and huge objects to fill in the background of
the stage.  Looking out into the auditorium, you can see rows and rows of
seats and a milk dispenser in the back.  The walls are... Why am I doing
this?  Most people don't even read the descriptions of the rooms unless
looking for a door of some sort!  Well there is no door here.  I bet you
have brief mode on, don't you?  So you are probably missing several of
our witty jokes!  Why must we go through all this painstaking writing of
descriptions, if they aren't going to be read?  You probably aren't even
reading this!  [Editorial :)]  Well, anyways, the only exit is to the
north.

It now contains bars hanging from the ceiling and where the desk should

in modern day hamster and gerbil cages.  The only exit is to the west.
