Text
I agree that this attributes on Kyrus are way unbalanced...
I think to counter this bug you should take hp/mana's
away from him.

I think that 500hp should be taken, followed by 800mana.
I think you will agree that that much is fair to take away.

Thanks,

Hey, I have come to hear upon some bad news. I was told
That this character, who is remorted is no longer going
to be around, since the remort system has been removed.
I was wondering if it is possible, however, to keep the name
'Kyrus' around. I was like to see this happen by renaming Haruka
to Kyrus. This would allow me to  still play a character that is named
Kyrus, and hance keep the name going.

Please get back to me on the subject.
Thanks alot,

Subject things to do~
Text
well I logged in tonight and lo and behold there are 8 people on
so for one I dont think this mud is dead yet.  But some changes 
have to be made to keep it going and this is what I was thinking...
we need to get rid of the detect stealth, why would you want to play thief
if anybody can detect you?  One of the main advantages of being a thief
was being able to stealth and not be detected.

Get rid of the hero quest, yea it was nice to have for a time but its become a bit
out of date, people just look at it as a hassle now and we still have an overabundace
of hero characters.

look back at what made this mud fun to play when it was just DLL?
simplicity, good areas, and castles.  Now the castle code is in for I see a few
people that have the moniker in front of their name.  Here is what I propose...
we put the castles in fully, opening it up for 4 pc's to create and run.
we get rid of those things that just throw the game out of wack, like farslay...
yea they are nice features and excellent code, but what is the fun of that when they
figure out the components, then we just have a bunch of people that can kill you from
afar.

I think the key is that we need to expand this game, no need to make a entire new game
when we have one already running :)

lets get rid of the random stats and put in the old ones, people like finding eq and knowing what it does
and so on and so forth, but what I do propose is that we put the limited high level gear in (the..
code that bb did is excellent) which will A) enhance pkill B) make people look for better items
and so on and so forth.

so what do you think?  get back to me when you can.

Subject TOC's future, my opinion...~
Text
The following note is to fully express my opinion on where TOC should be
headed in the coming months. It does not necessarily reflect the opinion of
any other members of the staff here. The code changes I'm suggesting do not
take a great deal of work and I am willing to make them on my own if the
powers that be desired that. 

1.) A PK environment with no option for playing the game past level 15 without
participating in the pk system.
2.) Addition of functional limited object code, a limited object
is an object which exists in a set number of instances throughout the world.
Meaning if another player has the Sword of Starlight you will have to kill
him to acquire it.
3.) Balance the class/guild combinations including the addition of a minimum
of 50 skills/spells, with the removal of certain late additions such as 
detect stealth, enchant item, and smite.
4.) Mobprogs.
5.) The addition of preset castles with associated powers, including a full
castle relic system, if your castle loses it's relic you lose your powers
until you regain it.
6.) Removal of heroquesting, removal of remorting, removal of "purchase" via
experience system. When remorting you become a completely new and functional class or race. 
Removal of random object stat system.
7.) Miscellaneous additions, add in the ROM 2.4 code which is functional and
useful, user defined prompts, affect locations, dynamic object effect system

I can honestly say that I could make these additions and changes on a test
port and add them into the game within a months time.

Hehe, it's 2k, and all of a sudden people get interested again, funny.
Just read a few notes, mainly those by Graves and Diab, and wanted to share my thoughts.

Both start with saying we need new things, then in the next line, they want to destroy
that that was added. Ironic, no?

Diab names a number of things that would seriously change the mud itself, which in itself
is fine by me of course, but was a source of problems in the past.
Another note I feel I have to place here is that his code is usually really bad.
Not trying to bring him down or anything, but I've seen other things by him that corrupted
a lot of other code hehe.

I'd feel safer if BB and I, and maybe Graves or Eclipse would imp it.
