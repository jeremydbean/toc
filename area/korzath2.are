You look into the book:

			     Castle Management
		       Written by Desak the Destined

	The following is a philosophy of my enlightened ideals of the
basic fundamentals of leading a castle that exists in a castle based
society, into becoming a dominating, stable, and influencial group or
system of individuals.  My many years of study on the subject since the
world has moved on has brought me to several conclusions on why castles
succeed and why they fail.  I have seen many rise and fall in my time and
I believe I have now devised the components necessary to make a castle
succeed in a hostile environment.
	It is important that I first of all explain what a castle consists
of.  A castle is an organized group that is usually made up of many
different individuals who all fight or support a certain cause. This
cause is, in most cases, a cause of either defending the weak, avenging
of the innocent, oppression of the meek, or a manifest search for utter
destructive chaos.

The woman senses your approach and raises her head.

     "You've completed the Hero test I see," she says, "the worst is
     yet to come I'm afraid."
     "What do you mean by that?" you ask.
     She scoffs at the question and shakes her head.  "You really don't
     understand this do you.  Do you think you passed those tests all
     your self?  Fools.  Korzath LET you pass.  He is the one who has
     allowed you to come this far, he is the one who has allowed you
     to invade his impenetrable fortress."
     "You're insane."
     "Am I?  You defeated the creatures in the Battleground.  You have
     beaten his best recruits for the Army of The Cause.  And now, now
     he wants to make you a part of his army.  He will defeat you if you
     find him.  He will take your soul and make you HIS."
     "Be sure to explore the Fortress, Gweedo will give you its secrets."

She bows her head and goes back to her meditation.

although once per quarter month is asking for too much of my time.

Heroes Hall~
     Gold plated walls line this hall of heroes.  Statues of heroes from
the days of old stand along the passage to the north.  A large crystal
statue stands in the very center of the hallway, almost blocking the way.
The statues arms are outstretched as if reaching out to you.  The left arm
holds a silver plated scroll and the right arm holds a gold plated scroll.
You can look at either scroll.  There is also a piece of the wall you can
look at.

		Of course not.  I have nothing but pity towards
		you fools.
		If you have come this far then maybe you've come
		for me.  Maybe you've come to stop the Cause in
		in its tracks.  I dare you to try.  Come further
		and I guarantee your death.  Find me and you'll
		lose your soul.  The choice is up to you.  I

way back out.  The two also slayed more of the wretched Grey Men then any
other group of players.
~
E
oreous two~

been plagued with leadership problems since it's beginning and Oreous
struggled to make the castle whole again.  Oreous is now gone, though
his soul has ascended into an immortal.
~
E
gant three~
	Gant led Silverglen along with Traveller.  While Traveller kept the
castle together, Gant worked to add more members.  The castle had nearly

position.  He interviewed countless possible recruits to find the ones
who would be the best candidates to become members of Silverglen.
~
E

	Successor to the throne of Silverglen, Traveller ruled his castle
with a swift and sure hand.  The castle that once held such peaceful values,
fell to corruption after Queen Katrina died of the plague.  Traveller took
over and quickly moved to Outcast the troublemakers of the castle: Strongarm
and Gunslinger.  He restored the lawful image to this once unlawful castle.
~
E
gunslinger five~

travels with Dax and ability to never be pkilled by Talen and Bruenor or
any other player.  His skills allowed him to steal the "Soul" item from
Meana, the item she received from Vladimyr on their wedding day.  Gunslinger
stole the soul from her after she tried to auction it away when she and
Vladimyr divorced.  Gunslinger was also the creator and first leader of the
Dark Circle of Silverglen.
~
E
vladimyr six~

and brought Shaded out of it's age of darkness to once again make it a
castle to be reckoned with.
~
E

E
talen eight~
	Talen, the first and most brutal leader of castle Perilous.
He led the castle along with his advisor Bruenor.  Together they spread
fear and plagued the land of Sembia with death and disease.  Their reign
was short lived as the opposing castles united to combat their tyranny.
When Talen departed and leadership changed hands, the castle ceased to
be as feared as before.
~
E
bruenor nine~
	Bruenor Bladesmith was the top advisor and most treasured assistant
to Talen, the leader of Perilous.  Bruenor was known for spreading plagues
among young adventurers who crossed his path.  He was feared by other
heroes even when he was not grouped with Talen.  At their peak they were
an elite team, but they found failure when it came to hunting.  The two
warriors had a furious hate for Gunslinger of Silverglen and spent countless
hours in search of the thief so that they could execute him.  They failed.
~
E
mithran ten~
	Mithran, second ruler of Silverglen.  Mithran took over as Castle
leader after King Telemid disappeared.  He selected Traveller as Chancellor
to the castle and ruled until he the day he vanished like Telemid had.

attaining the status of Hero on DLL.  He has returned to the land of Sembia
here on ToC to once again climb the mountain of levels to try and reach Hero

	legible)
~

loved Heroes of DLL.  She and Kasandra helped to create the Social Club

     The hall leads further east.  You can feel a soft breeze of cold
mountain air flowing east to west.  On the breeze is the smell of more

     Yes!  You pulled the correct lever!

     NOT

     You try to breathe and are met by the feeling of water filling
     your lungs instead of the feel of sweet, life giving oxygen.

     BUT.....

     There could be a way out depending on the levers you pulled....

Question~
     QUESTION #1:
		Sarmini has twelve apples.  Kalak comes by and gives
the healer five apples and the healer already had three apples.  Kalak had
twice the number of apples that the gnome man had before gnome man lost
seven apples to the goblins in a bet about how many apples Seraloi had
given to Kalak (which was six).  Raistlin bought nine apples from the
druids, leaving the druids with three times the amount that the gnome man
had after the bet.  After the betting Sarmini ate a green apple and the
gnome man had robbed Sarmini.  The gnome man had eleven apples before
losing the bet.  Before Raistlin bought the apples from the druids, he
had three times the apples that the gnome man had after the bet.  The
gnome man stole one third the amount of apples from Sarmini that Raistlin
had after he bought the apples from the druids.  The healer came by and
sold a quarter of his apples to the druids.
     Now, how many apples does each person have?  Make your answer in this
order: Sarmini, Kalak, Raistlin, Gnome man, Druids.  You have limited time
to move through the exit that has your answer.

Question~
     QUESTION #2:
		Paco the Pawn Shop owner was found murdered in Dresden.
The Mayor called for an immediate investigation to find out who had
committed such a ruthless crime.  The six subjects were Jazair the Nomad,
Stehnrik the Dwarven Guard, Maliki of the Wand shop, Darla the pet shop
girl, Bidom the Wizard, and Kalak the Blacksmith.  Each was interrogated
heavily.  Bidom confessed that he did the murder because Paco had robbed
some potions from his shop.  Jazair confessed that he did it because his
temper gets a hold of him sometimes.  Stehnrik was reduced to tears during
his interrogation and said he did the murder because he though Paco got
his sister pregnant.  Darla also cried many tears that flowed down the
outside part off her face as she confessed that Paco had fathered her child
but refused to help raise it.  Maliki claimed he did it because Paco sold
him a bad batch of firework wands, and Kalak said he killed Paco because
Paco was honing in on his business.  All of the suspects are lying because
of their interrogations.  Only one of the suspects committed the murder and
is playing along with the others by confessing.  Move through the exit that
has your answer as the exit description.  Time is limited.

     QUESTION #3:
		A tub is one hundred liters in size and it is filled
with ice.  When water becomes ice it expands by ten percent.  Because
of the difference in temperature, ice is melting at a rate of twenty
liters per minute.  After two minutes the room becomes cooler and ice
melts at a rate of ten liters per minute.  After a certain period of
time all the ice has melted.  Gioli is measuring the amount of water
that flows out of the tub.  His instruments add fifty percent to his
measurements.  Gioli will measure the overflow eight minutes after it
begins to melt.  What is Gioli's measurement?

     You stand before a long rope bridge that stretches the expanse of a
deep black chasm here inside the mountain.  The cavern here is so large
and dark that you cannot see walls or the ceiling.  You only see the
rock floor drop off into the endless looking chasm and the bridge that
goes over it.  Are you sure you want to cross this?

End of Freedom~
     The bridge and chasm come to an end on this small ledge of rock.  A
huge door stands before you and it glows with an etherally sick light.
At the foot of the door is a man whose blood is slowly spilling from his
body making a pool of bloody mud beneath him.  Through the cuts and blood
on his body you manage to make out the insignia on his arm plates.  The
plates identify this man as being one of the *Elite* Royal Guards of the
city of New Thalos.  He lifts a finger and beckons you to take a closer
look at him so he can speak with you.

of the creatures he has captured from other dimensions via Project Starlight
portals.  You glance around and see many different beasts that have never
crossed your path in the world of Sembia.  The Arena is surrounded by a one
hundred foot high black rock wall with towers placed at the four corners.
In the center of the arena is a + shaped rock structure.

it is advisable that you remove yourself from the premises now.  If you
wish to continue with the test then step north but beware.  Once you
travel north there will be only two ways to escape: complete the test
successfully or perish while attempting to complete it."

    A kinder, female voice speaks:

    "The loop will send you bouncing from loop room to loop room.  The
hero must solve this test by figuring out the one way to escape the loop.
Escaping the loop will take you to the deeper sect of the Fortress.  Failure
will result in your death.  Note that you cannot recall once you have

     All four types of castles I have defined have a chance at succeeding
in their belief.  I will first examine the fundamentals that apply to any
type of castle and then I will take a look at them to further explain
how each can find success or failure and why they will succeed or fail.

Leadership
""""""""""
	Strong leadership is imperative to the success of any castle.
A castle leader should possess the following:

	 -undying support and admiration from the castle members
	 -ability to speak well in diplomatic situations
	 -ability to make quick, wise decisions in the heat of the moment
	 -a known and feared presence in the community

	This last quality is important because if a leader is rarely seen
by his/her castle members or by anyone within the society then that leader
loses his/her reputation.			Continued on 3page
~
E
3page~
Castle Member Quality
"""""""""""""""""""""
	Most castles fight to gather as many members as they can possibly
gather.  In my opinion this is a mistake.  A castle should keep itself
small and tight.  If a castle is kept small then the members will know
each other, group together for combat, and have a united trust amongst
themselves.  If a castle gets too large then the members do not interact
as much as they should.  They may not even know the names of all the
members of their castle!
	If a "problem" should begin to arise then a large castle will
have more trouble dealing with it.  Such problems are:

	 -a scandal in which blame is laid on somebody in the castle
	 -members being killed by members of an opposing castle
	 -spys

						Continued on 4page
~
E
4page~
You continue to read on:
	A large castle will have a problem stopping spies from other castles
from infiltrating.  Another problem that was listed is when lower level
members get killed.  In most cases, the higher members of the castle will
spend countless hours helping the recently deceased.  While this is the good
samaritan thing to do, it can be detrimental to the castle as a whole.
	If a castle stays small and the members get to know each other
well then there is less of a chance of a spy infiltarting, scandal, and
deaths of castle members will most likely be reduced.  A group of 3-5
members who fight alongside each other often will learn the combat styles
and strategies of their companions.  A group like this is about 3 times
as deadly as a group of 6-10 people who barely know the names of their
fellow group members.  This shows a contrast to how a small castle can
have more advantages in the ways of castle life than a large castle.

Four Basic Types of Castle Themes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
	Now that we have examined the basic fundamentals of a successful
castle we will now look at the four basic themes that castles usually
base themselves on.

-Defending the Weak
     This type of castle is a lawful good type of castle that works
to protect the innocent and preserve law across the land and among the
other castles.  Most attempts at this type of castle fail due to the
strength and momentum that evil castles gain with the passage of time.
     For this type of castle to succeed it first of all needs a strong
leader as mentioned above.  Secondly, when the castle works to enforce the
protective laws it must find a way to deal with the law-breakers.  This is
usually done by hunting down and killing the individual who broke the law
and taking his/her equipment as punishment.  What hurts a lawful castle most
is failure to carry out this punishment.  If they attempt to punish the
individual of an evil castle who broke the law and the perpetrator escapes
then it damages the reputation of the good castle.   Continued on 6page
~
E
6page~
You continue to read:
     It is important that the good castle can retain the reputation of
being able to enforce the law efficiently, otherwise the evil castles
will not think twice before committing a crime because the chance of
being punished by the good castle is very low.  The evil castle won't be
hindered in committing crimes if they don't fear retribution.
     If the castle can establish a strong reputation for enforcing the law
and thus hinder the crimes committed by evil castles then it will have a
higher chance of succeeding.

-Avenging the Innocent
     Castles that avenge the innocent have similar goals to castles that
work to protect the innocent.  These castles are often neutral and can
usually have a high impact of the outcome of a war by deciding to ally
with one of the warring castles.
     This type of castle will need a strong leader as well but, this type
of castle does not necessarily have to succeed at anything, just survive.
It needs inner strength and unity more than it needs physical power in its
members.					 Continued on 7page
~
E
7page~
You continue to read:
-Oppression of the Meek
     Castles that choose this theme usually work to kill and pillage the
weak within the society.  These castles are either chaotic, evil or in
some rare cases choose to call themselves neutral.
     This type of castle needs a strong leader like all of the others.
A leader that is well trained in the ways of pkilling.  A leader that
can teach the members of the castle how to best carry out their goals.
They also need a number of strong members to create a feared presence
among the community.  That way they have a higher chance of finding the
weak when the weak come out of hiding.  If the members of this castle
learn to work together then they will have a better chance at killing the
not so weak members of the society and further enhance a feared presence
because they will establish a reputation for having killed some of the
more powerful and well known individuals of the community.
						Continued of 8page
~
E
8page~
-Chaos
     The final type of castle is the one whose sole goal is to create a
world full of utter chaos.  They are usually of chaotic/evil alingment.
     As with every castle this one requires a strong leader, preferably
one that is similar to the type needed in an oppressionistic castle.  The
castles members need to be physically strong and well trained in pkilling
as well.  The only difference between this type of castle and one that
oppresses is that they don't just attack the weak, they attack anything
that moves.  They use their thieves to steal gold and other various
possessions from people.  Anything that can cause a person strife is an
action that a chaotic castle will take.
     To succeed, a chaotic castle must overwhelm their opponents in combat.
They must be able to go into a fight and know they will come out the winners.
If the castle can make the other castles fear them then they have the upper
hand when it comes to negotiations or when making demands.

Conclusion
""""""""""
     Those are my conclusions on basic and necessary castle fundamentals
and how the basic four types of castle themes can become successful to
survive.  They are my opinions based on my years of experience and
research on the subject.  I feel that castle leaders can benefit greatly
though by following the suggestions and guidelines I have listed.

			    Good luck to you!!

could detect you and it has only heightened their determintaion to kill
you.

     Another slanted floor leads northward as well as to the west.  Elite
Imperial Soldiers swarm from the corridor to the north and storm towards
you.
     "Invaders! Slay the UNBELIEVERS!!" they scream as they charge to attack.

     This path leads towards the deepest part of the fortress.  Your light
barely manages to shed light on anything in the room.  The path is protected
by the Power of Shadows, a power that only Korzath is rumored to have control
of.  Suddenly the shadows around you shift and black shapes dart quickly
to descend on you.

     This is Korzath's private thinking chamber.  A pedestal stands at
the back of the room.  On the pedestal is a leather bound diary with gold
trim on the binding.  This might be where he has written down his intermost

24th week of 4th Quarter Month in the Ninth Dread

   At Midnight tonight our family will celebrate the coming of the Eighth
Dread.  Another year will have passed for us on this side of the Dragon
Sea.  For the past three quarter months I have travelled over this land
called 'Sembia' and fought in prize fights.  I've yet to lose a single bout
which has surprised me.  My parents have instilled me with unique combat
abilities, they spent years teaching me the art of combat but I thought my
training would only prepare me to equal the combatants of Sembia but that is
not so.  I OVERPOWER them.  I have yet to meet a challenging opponent.
   My streak of wins has helped me establish a name for myself, a name so
reputable that my uncle Markaroth asked me 2 quarter months ago to help him
promote the family business that my grandfather started.  I agreed to do so
and in return he has taught me much about the economies of the cities around
me.  I have learned enough that I believe I could run the business myself.
I have taken measures to take over the family business....tonight.

1st week of the 1st Quarter Month in the Eigth Dread
   My uncle Markoroth is dead now.  I ensured that one of the mages
providing the fireworks display for our New Dread celebration would
'remove' my uncle from the celebration as quickly and quietly as
possible.  Father wasn't pleased with my plan for going about having his
brother executed but, he supported it.  I noticed he provided a strong
security presence of Shadowmen in the crowd incase something had gone
awry.  I underestimated the people of Midgaard though, they suspect that
my Uncle was murdered, they just don't suspect me as the man who hired the
mage and the mage has been disposed of.
   I will now proceed to take over the business and run it for a short
period of time until I am ready to sell off all of the pieces of the
business and milk it for all it's worth.  I know my uncle put in his will
that I should take the family fortune and erect a temple next to the
Dragon Sea in honor of my grandfather's landing but I have other plans
for the fortune and that particular plot of land by the Sea.

20th week of the 4th Quarter Month in the Eigth Dread
   After many weeks and 2 quarter months, the first phase of my plan is
complete.  The mountain cave that served as my childhood home has now been
converted and enlarged into a massive, mighty fortress.  This fortress has
cost me a majority of the money I made from selling the business off but,
it will pay itself off in the long run.  I can use this fortress to train
my troops, manufacture armor and weapons, and research the various projects
that must be completed to help with the Cause.
   I was also surprised this week when a nomad brought word that Midgaard
had been destroyed by a massive draconian attack.  Rumor has it that the
Gods intervened and imprisioned Tiamat again.  She once again is trapped
in Dragon Tower, maybe I should release her one day.  It is a thought.  I
imagine that if the Gods decided to stop that attack then they may one day
try to stop the Cause.  I have a little something for them should they decide
to make that mistake.				Continued on 5diary

You read the next entry:
11th week of the 3rd Quarter Month in the Seventh Dread
   The city of Dresden has been erected near where Midgaard once stood.
I travelled there and was surprised by what I found in the Pawn Shop.
There in the case my eyes fell upon a book with our family insignia
engraved on the cover.  The book is my Grandfather's diary.  The
diary goes into disturbing detail about the ongoings in our home city
of Tandelador.  The reported ongoings have even given me nightmares.  I
can see why Zarith wanted to leave.
   My Father never knew this but, my grandfather's most treasured dream
was not to build a temple alongside the Dragon Sea but it was to one
day go back across the Sea to save his country from totally destroying
itself.  So, weeks ago I rented out a shipbuilding yard in New Thalos
and initiated the construction of a ship that I plan to send across the
Sea.						Continued on 6diary

15th week in the 4th Quarter Month of the Seventh Dread
   Once the ship is complete I will send a vast majority of my military
to the ship and send them along with Kazor, one of my best Guardian
advisors.
   My desire to explore what remains of the city of Tandelador far outweighs
my desire to rush into launching the final phases of the Cause.  I believe
that we first need to learn what we can from Tandelador, a vast amount
of technology may still remain there along with people who may have
survived the Purge.  We could learn so much from exploring that region.
The knowledge we could gain may possibly help us complete the Cause in
a faster, more effective manner.

12th week of the 1st Quarter Month in the Sixth Dread
   It has been awhile since my last entry.  My fortress has developed nicely.
The manufacturing section and engineering departments are operating as
planned.  Project Starlight is now nearly completed and we plan to begin
sending our newly trained military through the Project Starlight portals
with orders to bring back any new species they find.  I then plan to put
these beings into the Battleground Arena for full fledged combat competition.
The ones that are deemed the best will be implemented into the Army of the
Cause.  The rejects will be killed off or locked away for future use.
   The city of Dresden is flourishing but I have become concerned with it's
impact on the world of Sembia.  It has brought out countless individuals who
have begun adventuring and exploring the world around them.  Guilds have
been constructed within the walls of the town to help train these people.
Trainers like Tia, David, Seraloi, and Kalak have helped organize and
refine the training process.  It looks like their training expertise will
help to create a new breed of combatants who could prove to be quite
formiddable opponents.

17th week in the 2nd Quarter Month in the Fifth Dread
   It has been over one Dread since I have written an entry and much has
happened.  The ship is nearly complete and soon I will send most of my armies
across the Sea to explore my ancestral homeland of Illisandia.
   I don't know what they will encounter there though so I must hope for the
best because I am not so sure about how easy it will be to lay conquest to
this land of Sembia.
   The reason my confidence has been shaken is because the quality of the
adventurers (who have originated from Dresden) is much much higher then
I expected.  Some have even aquired a status they call "HERO"
   I did suspect that this would happen though so I do have a plan.  I have
changed the construct of the inner fortress into 3 Hero Tests.  I believe
these tests to be difficult and should any "Heroes" pass these tests then
they will get to me and my Master Guardian familiar.  Once they arrive
we will use our combined powers to turn them to our side and use them in
our Army of the Cause! MUAHAHAHHAHAH!

24th week in the 4th Quarter Month of the Fifth Dread
   The Fourth Dread is almost upon us but, so are a group of Heroes.
They have managed to pass the tests and are approaching the room where
my Master Guardian and I await.
   There is one bad side to this though.  My Guardian and I have forseen
a group of Heroes in our dreams, a group of Heroes that come to this very
room and kill us.
   I realize that many of my dreams have come true while some of them have
not.  I hope now that the dream is incorrect but I have made plans incase
the nightmares comes true.
   Kazor has been ordered to take all the Lord Generals, Lord Commanders,
Elite Imperial Soldiers, and Fades with him to the ship and sail for
Tandelador.  I have ordered this regardless of whether I die or not
because I don't feel that we can complete the Cause without capturing
Heroes.  Project Starlight has given us so much help, we learned and
developed so much advanced technology by using those portals but, I feel
that we desperately need to aquire technology from Tandelador.  I wish
you the best of luck Kazor.

     The vortex has dropped you here in a pitch black room.  The floor
beneath you shuffles and grinds as you feel it move upward.  Higher and
higher it goes, the air flowing past your face as you continue to rise
at a rapid rate.  The darkness of the floor begins to fade as a huge deep
blue swirl begins to show itself underneath you.  You can see that the
blue light is eminating from a swirling groove engraved in the floor.
Finally, the floor stops moving and two shapes reveal themselves from
the darkness around you.
     "Welcome to my humble abode young travellers," Korzath says, "Stay
awhile...in fact....STAY FOREVER!"
     A Sword of Starlight appears in Korzath's hands and the darkness of
the room is destroyed by the utterly powerful light produced by the Sword.

     Looks like you chose the wrong answer or you took too long to choose
one.  You don't have long to live now, maybe you can spend your last few
minutes of life figuring out the correct answer.

    However, Haze does believe in giving people second chances.....and third
and fourth.......and fifth chances...well you get the picture SO if you hang
on to your precious life long enough you just might find yourself teleported
to safety.
