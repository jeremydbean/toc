Down a spiraling web~
     You have made it through the energy barrier and are now walking down a
spiraling web.  Looking back you realize you have to work your way on forward
because spiders have covered the way back in web.

The Altar~
     You are standing in front of a highly and freshly bloodstained altar.
Engraved on the top of the altar is a giant spider with a human head. Above
the altar is a barrier of weblike energy.  Behind it you can see only
darkness.

Slave Cells~
     This is the main room to the cell chambers for the slaves to be

Slave Pen~
     Rotten meat and breads lie about the floor while shackles hang from the
walls. The room wreaks of death. You almost become nauseous and decide to leave
the room since you were obviously too late to save the slave.

Dais~
     You stand upon a dais behind the altar. Above you is a enormous illusion
of a female drow turning into a giant spider and back again. On the center of
the dais stands a burning brazier opening a door to another plane.  There is
a door to the west.

The Treasury~
     This is obviously only a temporary storage place for the collected
treasure being rather bare.

Weaponsmaster's Chamber~
     This one person bedchamber is very elegant. The owner must be held in high
to get this kind of treatment.

The Chamber of Bones.~
     As you enter the building you realize that while walking down the tunnel
the web has slowly turned to bone.  As a matter of fact this whole chamber is
made of bone.  It's HUGE.  Your light can't begin to penetrate the darkness
and remains of beings long dead and freshly slain are scattered all over the
floor.  You think you can see a shape onward in the darkness.
