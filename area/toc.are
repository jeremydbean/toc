-1 'NEWBIE INFO'~
Be welcome oh adventurer.  Since you are new to the game, your best course
of action is to traverse the mud school before journeying on to other realms.
It's designed to help you learn the basics of the game.  Make sure you read
all the signs in the area, as they will add helpful hints on how things work.
Just north of you, you will find rooms to the east and west. Make sure you
visit them and follow the helps. To see a list of the Equipment you are
wearing, type: equipment. To see if you have spells to cast type: spells.
To see a list of your skills type: skills. For a list of available commands
type: commands.  To see basic information about yourself type: score.

* For new players:
     Don't try to kill the blob in mudschool.

To see a lot more useful information, type: help beginners
~

1 IGNORE~
Syntax: ignore
        ignore <character name>
        ignore nobody

Typing ignore by itself will show you a list of the people that you are ignoring.
Putting someone on your ignore list will prevent them from telling to you.  Typing
ignore nobody will clear your ignore list.

~


-1 BEGINNERS~

Welcome to Aaron's Time of Chaos...

This is a guide for new players. Help <name> will have most of the information
you will need.  Typing 'help' by itself will bring up a command summary.
Type 'help keyword' to see a list of the available help files.

Here's a list of useful commands to find out more about the game:

command - displays all the available commands in ToC

social  - displays all social commands in ToC. These socials do not
affect the game in any way except to enhance playing as a more effective
means to express your character.
Note: There is no help available for socials. Feel free to try them out.

gossip <...> - This is the usual way of how players speak to one another
where <...> is what you want said. Gossip is one of many channels
available to you. It is most useful as it is a public channel, meaning
every player can 'listen' to gossip. Use it to ask for help or just to
get to know the mud.  You cannot use the gossip channel (or other public
channels) until you reach level 2.

tell <name> <...> - Tell is another channel for private conversations
between 2 people.

color - You can enable color by typing color on, and color default.
see help color for more information.

Mud School
==========

New players should go through Mud School to learn the basics of mudding.
When you first enter ToC, your character is placed at the Entrance to Mud
School. Read the descriptions carefully as many instructions are shown in
room descriptions.  Be sure to continue to the end to receive your MUD
school diploma!  Wearing it will give you a boost to your leveling stats!

To move in any direction, simply type the first letter.

Example: To move north, type n or N (Upper/Lower case doesn't matter)

To look at a room, type look.

Your character has 3 vital signs, namely Hit Points (hp), Mana, and
Endurance (end).

Hit Points represent the amount of life your character has. Should your hp
ever get below -10, you have died. If it reaches 0 or lower, you have
been knocked unconscious and require assistance ... quickly.

Mana is the magic force pulsing through your veins. Mana is used to cast
magic spells and certain specialized skills. Spellcasting classes
generally have more mana than non-spellcasting classes.

Endurance is used each time your character moves. Certain spells/skills
affect how much end is needed each time your character moves.


Dying
=====

If you have died, all is not lost. Ask higher level players for help in a
Corpse Retrieval (CR) or if possible, go back to the same place where you
died and get back your stuff. Once you have reached your corpse, just get
all the equipment from your corpse and you will be exactly the same as
before -  give or take a couple of experience points :)
See help DYING for more information.

To get everything from corpse, type get all corpse.


Places of interest
==================

Here are a couple of low level areas to attract your interest:

Mob Factory - A stinking cesspool of drunks and workers, guarded by thugs
employed by Foreman Floyd. Occasionally, you may come across horribly
deformed guard dogs, affected by the slime pools around the facility.
Be forewarned: this area is not for the meek.

Dwarven Day Care - This delightful nursery cares for the offspring of
the nearby dwarven kingdoms and mines. Nannies are scattered around the
area, mothering these toddlers. They are quick to anger should one make a
false move.

Smurfs - Welcome to the world of those tiny little blue creatures we all
know and love. The entire gang is here -  Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Brainy..etc.

Some areas have aggressive monsters (monsters which attack without
provocation) like Dwarven Day Care.

There's a Newbie Train, up from the Entrance to Mud School, which can
take you to these places and more.


General MUD Terms
=================

Some of the basic Mud abbreviations used are:

AFK  - Away from Keyboard. Person is away from the keyboard; therefore
       character is temporarily unavailable.
BRB  - Be Right Back. Self-explanatory. Often used in conjunction with AFK.
CR   - Corpse Retrieval. After a player has died, this is what the process
       of getting back the corpse is called.
ROFL - Roll On the Floor Laughing. A common social used to express humor.
RL   - Real Life. Helps separates realities when speaking to other players.
DTD  - Some software programs allow the person to 'drop to dos'
Mob  - Short for mobile, which is what most monsters in the game are referred
       to as.
NPC  - Non-Player-Character: all mobiles
PC   - Player-Character: All Players. Immortals are considered NPC's.

And that's it. Remember, this is only a game and we are all here to have FUN!

Enjoy...

~

62 IMOTD~
Welcome Immortal!



~

62 JOBS~
Helps for Immortals are listed under a help file for your corresponding
level, i.e. help immortal, help angel, etc.
All job descriptions work in a top down fashion, meaning you are also
responsible for the jobs of the immortal levels below you, if there are
any.  These jobs are just listed as general purpose and not all encompassing.
There is also a help file for running 'quests' that all immortals need
to read. It sets down guide-lines for prizes/difficulty level.  Also
to be read by all immortals is: help commandments.
~

62 QUESTS~
Sorry not in yet.
~
0 HEROQUEST~
When you embark on a hero quest, the following commands can be used
at the Questmaster:

heroquest: This wil start the quest.
listclue: This will relist the clue you are on.
retrieved <item name>: This will make the Questmaster tell you if the clue
		       is correct or not. If it is, the next clue will be
		       listed.
endquest: This will end your quest, but there are stiff penalties for doing
	  so. Use this as a last resort, when all else has failed. It is
	  advised that you quit the game for a little while before doing
	  this though to give yourself  a chance to cool off your frustration.
	  By ending a Hero Quest, you may not start one again for 7 days
	  real time. The Quest Master will inform you on how long you
	  have left to wait.

Discussion of any hero quest clues or items before or after the hero quest
is a SERIOUS offense, and will be enforced. If you have another Player Char
and are caught discussing the clues/items that your Hero PC encountered, or
are caught using that PC to communicate in any way for your Hero PC, both
that PC and your Hero will SUFFER SEVERE PENALTIES, NO EXCEPTIONS!!!
~

51 HEROLEVELS~
See help on exchange. More help on herolevels will be added later.
~

62 MARTYR~
You job is to prove to the Implementors that you are worthy of advancement
to a higher Immortal level, either by running decent quests <not common
place ones>, helping out the other immortals by finding bugs or assisting
in finding bugs, area creation, and generally staying out of trouble.
You were not given an immortal to boost your ego, so bragging to players
that you have one will not be looked upon kindly.  At this level, you
are subject to deletion at the discretion of the implementors, so don't
screw up.  Some players are granted this status for helping out with
the game in the past, and the above does not entirely apply to them.
~

63 IMMORTAL~
Your job is to help new players out.  This does not mean you
will give out information about where stuff is, or what something does, or
how to get somewhere. You could however tell them to go check out the newbie
train. It means that if someone is clueless, you can say: 'go through the mud
school and read the signs', or 'Well, when I was a newbie, I found it a good
idea to train 'such and such' a skill/spell/attribute, but this is just my
opinion.' You are not to nursemaid the players. Only help out when someone is
in need of it.  Also, if someone has a bug to report, go listen to them.
Getting player input is very important, even if their opinions or supposed
bugs may seem off the wall so to speak.  You can also run minor quests,
though you must have at least 10 people wishing to participate in them.
Read the help file 'Quests' for more information.
~

64 AVATAR~
Your job is to run quests for the players.  One doesn't have to be run
every day, but once a week at pre-set times, or even random intervals
would be good.  Having quests livens up the game and is a very important
part of making the game interesting.
~

65 ANGEL~
Your job is to socialize with the players. Don't bother them if they don't
want your company. Ask questions pertaining to the game, get their opinions
on how things are set up, or if they think something is unfair or out of
balance, or needs changing.  Take their comments with a grain of salt, as
a lot of people are going to say 'this sucks' or 'this is unfair' or
'I need a spell that kills everything', etc.  You can also run quests, and
are obligated to assist other immortals running them.  Read the help on
quests.
~

66 ARCHANGEL ARCH-ANGEL~
Your job is to keep tabs on game balance.  This covers many
topics.  Keep tabs on object stats and whether they should be lowered or
increased, or if something about the object isn't the way it should be.
Discriminately watch how PC's go about playing the game.  In most
cases do this by asking if you can follow them around.  In some cases you
can follow without making your presence known, but avoid invading privacy.
Check stats on mobs to see if they are correct, in your opinion, or if
something needs changing.
~

67 DEMIGODS DEMI-GODS~
Your job is to keep the peace.  This means if someone is being
obnoxious, kindly ask them to stop the annoying behaviour.  If they
persist, you can remove their channels until they simmer down.  If they
are a blatant pain, gossiping foul language and such, nochannel them and
dump them in jail.  Jailing is usually only for those players that
log on a level one just to make trouble, not players who spend a lot of time
on the game, though they too can be jailed if the circumstances are extreme.
Make sure you leave a note concerning the incident.
~

68 DEITY~
Your job is to make sure that all the rules of the game are being followed.
This includes both mortal and immortal.  You are also responsible for
reimbursements, whether this includes loading a few items, or doing a
complete restore of the character.  Characters that delete themselves will
not be reimbursed 99% of the time; you'll have to make a judgement call for
the other 1% of the cases.  Reimbursed items that are loaded will be loaded
at the level of an existing item in the game, or the character's level if the
object is known to be in that level range.
~

69 GODS~
Your job is ... well ... I have no idea what your job is right now.
To come up with new ideas for the game, or ideas to help speed up game
performance I guess.
~

62 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES'~
.
			 **********************
			 ** The Rules of ToC **
			 **********************

1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.

2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own.
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,
    and softening up or altering mobs.  It also includes giving out
    object stats or mobs stats.

3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    Let them explore.

4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.

5)  DO NOT use reboot.  Plain and simple.

6)  Do not give out free equipment.  Items for quests are ok, if the item
    fits the difficulty of the quest listed in 'help quest'.

7)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their privileges.  They are being punished for a reason.

8)  Try not to overrule each other.

9)  Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

10) If your mortal character has a disagreement with a player, do not use
    your immortal to get even, in any way shape or form.  Keep your mortals
    and your immortal disassociated from one another.

-1 HERBIE ANGEL~
Herbie, the wonder angel, will at odd times come to your aid and cure you of
all your wounds. He's not something to be relied on though.
~

-1 RULES~

These are the rules of ToC.  For other matters, USE COMMON SENSE.

Rules for everything that can be done wrong can't possibly be written,
because some things are just not thought of.  If you get called out
for doing something wrong by the Immortals don't retort with it isn't
against the rules.  USE COMMON SENSE.

Note that all punishments also include confiscation of any items obtained
by breaking a rule.

* Foul and/or abusive language will not be tolerated on ToC, from anyone
  (including gods). This applies to all public channels and to say and
  emote used in public areas.  On private channels, please respect other
  people and discontinue using language they tell you they find offensive.

* Sexual harassment of any form will not be tolerated, punishable by deletion
  This MUD does not exist for you to belittle others.. It exists solely for
  the entertainment of all.. Violate someone's civil rights and you're gone,
  no exceptions!!

* We created this game for your enjoyment.  While we don't like the line
  "your being here is a privilege not a right", your use of the game can
  and will be removed if we so deem it necessary for the good of the MUD.

* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.

* If an immortal speaks to you, listen and do as told. Don't argue, just do
  it.  Immortals have a tough enough job without dealing with bad attitudes.

* This is a pKill MUD.  If you decide to become pKillable (SEE HELP PKILL),
  then live (or die) with that decision.  Any complaints in regards to being
  pKilled will fall upon deaf ears.

* Do not bring aggressive mobs to lower level areas other than the ones they
  belong in.  Charming aggressive mobs and bringing them to Dresden is
  looked on particularly strongly.

62 PUNISHED~
This space is intended to keep a running list of punishments.
Regularly updating the list will enable us to determine what is a

-1 LYCANTHROPY~
Lycanthropy is a magical disease out of legend, with the main affect on
the afflicted being that on the Full Moon, the diseased person turns into
a Were-Creature. The most commonly known form is the Were-Wolf. The
disease is transmitted by being bitten by a being that is already
afflicted with Lycanthropy. The first Were-Creature was probably created
by some kind of Curse long ago, and has mutated into it's current form.
Were-Creatures typically carry 1-4 items, depending on there size, and
have no worries about death. There is currently know known cure for this
disease.

-1 TAX TAXES~
Providing subissue equipment to newbies, training guards to protect the city
of Dresden against killers and thieves, and furnishing the mayors office
in high style are all expensive.  In order to keep everything running
smoothly, ToC taxes the wealthiest citizens.  This tax amounts to 50% of
all gold above 1 million coins, each and every time you log on.

-1 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code. It can
be found on Rehobaom's Legacy, at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

The New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bugs reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

Bug reports --
    Thanks to Shad Muegge, Jerome Despret, Phoenix, Will Hongach,
    Erwin S. Andreasen, Adam Debus and especially Gary Turkington
    (author of the ROM FAQ) for help spotting bugs

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's work on
Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes

-1 'RACE HELP' 'RACE' 'RACES'~
ToC has the following races for player characters:

Human    the standard race
Dwarf    good warriors and priests
Elf      good thieves and mages
Hobbit   good thieves
Saurian  unique race. difficult to play

Different races have different starting statistics, and also different
stat maximums for magic items and training.

Each race requires different experience to gain a new level depending
on what class you chose to be. Also, some classes are race restricted,
those being:

Monk       : Human and Dwarf only
Necromancer: Human and elf only
~

-1 DWARF DWARVES~
Dwarves are a short, stocky demi-human race, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.

Dwarves are resistant to magic, poison and disease, but cannot swim, and
so are very vulnerable to drowning.  They receive the bash skill for free.

The experience needed per level for dwarves is:

Mage:2200  Cleric:2150  Thief:2150  Warrior:2125  Monk:2400
~

-1 ELF ELVES~
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or priests.

Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously
hard to spot, and so receive the sneak skill automatically.

The experience needed per level for elves is:

Mage:2100  Cleric:2125  Thief:2150  Warrior:2200  Necro:2300
~

-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~
Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versatile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may
also train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to
gain more benefit from magical devices.

The experience needed per level for humans is:

Mage:2000  Cleric:2000  Thief:2000  Warrior:2000  Monk:2300  Necro:2000
~

-1 HOBBIT HALFLING~
Hobbits are a demi-human race, slightly shorter than dwarves. They resist
poison and disease like dwarves.  They are vulnerable to strong wind,
due to there small size and weight.  Of all the races, they they have the
highest dexterity.  Hobbits gain the hide skill automatically and are able
to duck under attacks.

The experience needed per level for hobbits is:

Mage:2200  Cleric:2150  Thief:2125  Warrior:2150
~

-1 SAURIAN~
The Saurian race migrated to this world when theirs was on the brink of
destruction.  When it was discovered that their world would soon perish,
the mages created a powerful dimensional portal.  So much power was focused
into it, though, that all that could be discerned was that the terminus world
was habitable, and so they arrived here.  Their world's atmosphere was harsher
than here, giving them a strong immune system.  They are Immune to poison,
and resist fire, but are vulnerable to cold due to their reptilian nature.  They
also have a chance of getting a bonus attack with their tail in combat.

The experience needed per level for saurians is:

Mage:2200  Cleric:2150  Thief:2250  Warrior:2200
~

-1 SPELLGROUP~
Classes that can cast spells can gain certain groups of spells, depending on
whether they are multi-class or full class. The following helps will show a
list of what spells/skills are in each group, and how much it will cost to

						ANNIHILATE

And, at the far reaches of damaging power, you can do UNSPEAKABLE things.
~

0 DYING~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Devota.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you, however.
The act of retrieving your equipment is referred to as a corpse retrieval and
is commonly abbreviated as CR.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half-way back to
the beginning of your level.  Thus, if you have a bad day and die several
times, the penalties won't clobber you.

Corpses decay after time. For mobiles, the objects inside corpses decay with
the corpse.  If a player's corpse decays, his or her equipment will remain
on the ground where he died.  Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of
game time (i.e. 30 ticks; see help TICK for more info on how this corresponds
to real time.)

Normally, only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can
retrieve objects from a player's corpse.  However, the noloot flag may be
turned off to allow others to retrieve items from your corpse; read help
NOLOOT for more information.  In addition, the corpses of those who have a
KILLER, THIEF or TRAITOR flag may be looted by anyone.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  The number of
experience points you need to advance a level is determined by your race
and class.


You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; your age in hours; and some random variation.
~

-1 GUILDS~
The guild system on ToC is designed to allow players to gain knowledge in
a class other than the one they started with or to become specialized in
their chosen profession.  This creates something that is close to a
multi-class character.  In order to pick up another class you will have to
make some sacrifices in what you can learn.  For example, those whose
primary class is other than mage cannot learn some of the higher level
magical spells.  You can only join one guild in a lifetime and you cannot
'un-guild' once you join.  When you join a guild, you will have access to
that guild's meeting place, which is protected by a powerful guard whose
sole job is keeping those who are not members from entering.

To join a guild, look for Melancholy in the oak tree as he has the
necessary paperwork to register your membership in the guild of your choice.
Read help JOIN for more information on joining a guild.  NOTE THAT IF
YOU DO NOT JOIN A GUILD BY LEVEL 6, YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED
IN THE GUILD THAT CORRESPONDS TO YOUR CLASS AND WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY
GAIN THE DEFAULT GUILD SKILLS.  That is, you will have to spend trains to
gain your guild default.  In addition, monks and necromancers are not
permitted to multiclass and are, therefore, automatically enrolled in their
corresponding guilds when they begin.

If you multiclass it may raise the amount of experience you need per level,
depending on your race.  The additional experience needed is:

	 mageguild   clericguild    thiefguild    warriorguild

dwarf     200           150             125            200

elf       100           125             150            200

human       0             0              0              0

hobbit    200           150             125            150

saurian   200           150             250            200


For more help on the individual guilds see helps on:

UNIVERSITY OF MAGIC (mages' guild)
TEMPLE OF BREAS (clerics' guild)
CITADEL OF WAR (warriors' guild
HOUSE OF THIEVES (thieves' guild)
PALM OF THE CREATOR (monks' guild - not available for multiclass)
MORGUE OF DRESDEN (necromancers' guild - not available for multiclass)

After you have joined a guild, you can type gainlist to show where you
can gain which skill/group. You can then also type teachlist where you
can learn your new skills/spells.

~


0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 60 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 40 seconds to 80 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area, less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
