Entrance to Azeroth~
You are surrounded by several massive stones while behind you is the
dark portal. The Orcs used this portal to gain entrance to Azeroth. Now
you are in the heart of the Orcish empire, Black Rock Spire. To the
south you see a rather impressive wall and two guard towers with a gate
between them. Mountains roll around this area in the distance creating a
perfect defense. The only noticeable exit is south and back into the
portal. There is a sign here with a skull on the end of it.

Along the Northern Wall~
In the distance you can see a massive castle under heavy construction.
It must be Stormwind Keep.  There are exits to the east and south.

A well Used Path~
You are traveling on a dirt path that heads west, north, and south. This
trail is constantly being used by the armies of Azeroth. As a matter of
fact, there are several soldiers walking on it right now. Stormwind Keep
lies just ahead of you, about one hundred yards away.

In Front of the Massive Gate~
Before you stands Stormwind Keep! It is so huge, and it's also under
construction. It was destroyed in the first war with the orcs along with
the humans' ruler, King Lane. Now it is being rebuilt by the new king,
and it looks like it's going to be bigger than ever! There is an exit to
the east and a sign right in front of you.

sign~
Welcome to Stormwind Keep, if you obey the rules you'll be fine. If you
do not obey the rules you will be punished. Also, if you interfere with
the resurrection of Stormwind you will be severely punished!

Watch Your Step!~
Don't you hate it when that happens?  You just walked through some
bushes and slid down the side of a cliff. I don't think you'll be going
back the way you came. Just ahead you notice a portal with several
gargantuan stones surrounding it. There are no exits in this room,
except through the portal.
