A dark apparition flings itself at you with a bonegrinding shriek.
~ 
   The sole purpose of this dead spirit is to spread fear, seeking revenge
for the evil way the draconians murdered him. It can take any form it wants,
look any way it wants, usually choosing horrible, disgusting forms, such as
mutilated animate corpses, that strike fear in any conscious man's mind.

From out of his shadowy shelter, a winged serpent hisses at you menacingly.
~ 
   These feathered, black snakes have bat wings and can grow till up to 
ten feet long. They reside in ancient swamps, ruins, underground caverns and
other dark and mysterious places. The Midgaard ruins, being sheltered by the
woods, thus form a perfect habitat.

the shadow assassin~
A shadowy assassin materializes in front of you, its dagger raised.
~
   The spirits of dead assassins and nightblades, these entities are often 
conjured up by foul necromancers and dark priests or magi to slay their 
enemies. They are dark, unsubstantial in form with yellow, piercing eyes. 
A shadow assassin is crafty, shrewd and has no mercy. It has no qualms 
about slaying anyone that gets in the way of his mission. After completing 
its mission it will discorpeate and his soul will return to the realm of 
the dead until it is summoned again.

black dragon~
the Black Dragon~
A Great Black Wyrm sleeps here, lying protectively over his treasure.
~
   These great lizards usually make their homes in marshes and jungles. 
Black dragons are impulsive and nervous, tending to act first and think 
later. Because of their independence, they are seldom used by Takhisis 
except in times of great need. This particular one seems to have been 
commanded to take the ruins of Midgaard as his domain though, which means 
that the ruins, or maybe something buried beneath them, must be valued 
highly by the Dark Queen. Black dragons are unpredictable in what they 
hold precious ... some covet piles of coins and gems, while others have 
collected only weapons.

aurak draconian~
the Aurak~
An Aurak is observing your every move from behind some crumbled walls.
~
   The Auraks are the special agents of the Queen of Darkness. These
draconians have no wings and as such cannot fly. Still they move swiftly on
foot and have very accute senses. They have the innate power of infravision,
can detect hidden and invisible objects and can even see through illusions. 
They are of normal human length, but have reptilian scaled hides, a thick 
tail and clawed hands and feet. Before it dies, the escaping magic energy 
transforms it into a green lightning ball and finally explodes.

baaz draconian~
the Baaz~
A Baaz, diguised in thieves clothing, is listening in on some conversations.
~
   Weak of mind and character, Baaz appear as men with scaly, patterned skin
and tail. Small wings, which they often cover with cloaks or other clothes,
protrude from their shoulder bones. Many of these draconians have doglike
snouts. The most human-like of this species become the spies of the Dragon-
armies. When these creatures are killed, they turn into a substance similar
to stone, trapping inside whatever dealt the final blow.

bozak draconian~
the Bozak~
A Bozak rummages through the ruins in search of spell components.
~
   Bozak are typically six to six and a half feet tall and covered with
bronze-hued scales. The scales are small and fishlike on the draconian's
face, hands and feet, but about the size of a copper piece on the remainder
of the off-spring's body. They also have some leathery wings wich enables
them to glide on the thermals and limited flying abilities. Bozak are spell-
casters and serve as special forces and commanders for their Dark Queen. When 
killed, a Bozak's flesh becomes dry and brittle, turning to dust. The bones 
begin to vibrate, then explode violently, hitting all within a ten feet range.

kapak draconian~
the Kapak~
A Kapak is sneaking through the ruins, ready to plant a knife in your back.
~
   Kapaks look less like humans than Baaz. They have a short mane that
hangs down to one side of their mouth, large leathery wings, which makes them 
fair at gliding. They disdain clothes, considering them worthless trapping of
humans. Kapaks are generally ignorant, ill-mannered, famished and witless.
They are best-suited to a military lifestyle, where their movements and 
actions are directed by more intelligent draconians, such as Baaz or Bozak. 
They prefer close fighting, where their venomous saliva and curving claws work 
to best effect. Kapaks serve as skirmishers and assassins in the Dark Queen's
army. When they are slain, their body dissolves into a pool of acid.

sivak draconian~
the Sivak~
A Sivak marches through the ruins in search of a fight and loot.
~
   Sivak are the largest and sturdiest draconians. They are the elite forces
of the Dragonarmies, shock troops wielding mighty flails and two-handed swords.
Even so, like Kapaks, they need direction. Their small minds have trouble con-
cocting long-range plans and elaborate tactics. Their great strength makes them
accomplished fliers, but their most devastating ability is their mastery of
shapechanging into the form of someone they just killed and maquerading as that
person. When a Sivak is slain, they shapechange into the form of their slayer.
They retain this death shape for three days, after which their form bursts into
flames and is reduced to black soot.

the Death Knight~
A Death Knight stands in the scrub grown streets challenging you to a duel.
~
   Death Knights are the tragic corruption of knights who have betrayed their
honor and vow. This one faltered and fled during the attack of the dragons on
Midgaard, leaving the populace defenseless. A death knight retains the fighting
skills it had in life, but also some tortured sense of nobility: he will not
attack from an ambush, nor attack an unarmed person.

the Skeleton Warrior~
A Skeleton Warrior is roaming the Midgaard ruins in search of his circlet.
~ 
   These undead lords were created when their life essences were trapped
within their golden circlets. Skeleton warriors continually look for their
circlets. Anyone possessing one of these circlets can control the warrior,
but those not aware of how to control the warrior risk disaster. Skeleton
warriors will not rest until they and their circlets are destroyed.

An Algroth leaps in front of you from behind a large elm-grove.
~ 
   You see a non-human creature, somewhat distantly related to Trolls. 
Algroths are huge, with apelike arms and sharp, venomous claws instead 
of fingers. Their faces are goatish, surmounted by short sharp-pointed 
horns. They have long, yellow fangs and their scaly, reptilian skin is 
of a loathsome grey color. They usually dwell in the mountain forests 
of Ulgo, but driven by hunger they have now come in search of food near 
the ruins of Midgaard.

the Eldrak~
An Eldrak is roaming through forest and the ruins in search of food.
~ 
   The Eldrakyn are related to Algroths and Trolls, but are more intelligent 
and much bigger. They are big, quick and cruel. An Eldrak will eat anything 
that moves and doesn't rally care if it's dead or not before he starts to eat. 
They are about eight feet tall and covered with shaggy black fur. The Eldrakyn 
have virtually no nose, and their lower jaw juts, showing two massive protru-
ding tusks. Their eyes are sunk in deep sockets beneath a heavy ridge of bone 
across their brow, and they are burned with a hideous hunger.

the rock wolf~
A rock wolf is lurking within the forest, seeking for an easy prey. 
~ 
   Its forelegs are noticeably longer than its hind ones, giving it a 
peculiar, half-erect stance, and there is a large, muscular hump across its 
shoulders. Its muzzle is short, and it seems snub-faced, almost like a cat's. 
Its coat is a splotchy black and white, marked with a pattern hovering some-
where between spots and stripes. It stares at you with a dreadful intensity
while yelping its high-pitched, hooting laugh.

not just gliding. Dreadwing's eyes always glow an eerie, pale blue. They
are highly skilled in using their talons and tooth filled mouths in combat.

that was pure in the woods, the vampiric unicorn has now become a menace, 
feared by all within the Sembian realms. It has the beauty of the unicorn 
still, but there is an evil about it now, so profound, so veil, it makes

can be encountered in human form, or in were-form, which looks like a wolf-man
with long claws and huge bat wings.

Destroyed Inner Sanctum~
This was once the great inner sanctum of the Clerics.  All about you, you
see signs of destruction.  Scorch marks covers the walls where once
pictures hung and a half an altar lies abandoned against the western wall.
Bones can be seen amongst the debri.  A well in the middle of the floor 
leads down into darkness.  Vile smells waft from the depths.

time, trying to get back up through the hole seems futile.  It is about
this time you realize you are not alone . . .

the hairs in the nape of your neck rise. The sullen atmosphere of the woods
rubbs off on you and where you were light-hearted before, you now feel gloomy
and depressed. The dust trail continues to the west and a large sign has been
placed alongside it. Not far from it, a scroll wavers in the air. Who placed
it there and how it can just keep on hovering in the air like that, baffles 
you. Willow trees block the north and the south, you can only go deeper into

   The dust trail is flanked by a big, ancient looking elm grove to the east
and a grassy field to the west. The trail continues south and north, with
here and there a few small stones, that can hardly count as pavement.

A small entrance to the Midgaard Woods~
   You just stepped on a small, dusty trail leading into the Midgaard Woods.
The sudden silence startles you ... the humming of the bees has stopped, as
has the chirring of the crickets. Then a hoarse shriek fills the air, making
the hairs in the nape of your neck rise. The sullen atmosphere of the woods
rubbs off on you and where you were light-hearted before, you now feel gloomy
and depressed. The dust trail continues to the east and a large sign has been
placed alongside it. Not far from it, a scroll wavers in the air. Who placed
it there and how it can just keep on hovering in the air like that, baffles 
you. Weeping willows block the west and the south, you can only go deeper 
into the woods or return.

have now reached the heart of the swamplands and all around you, the ground 
has become treacherous ... what seem to be ordinary bushes and undergrowth, 
turn out to be vegetation floating on murky water ... what seems to be solid 
ground turns out to be one of the many bottomless pits, filled with quicksand.
Gloomy trunks of half-decayed weeping willows occasionally loom up from out 
of the mist.

In the mist~
   You still find yourself crawling through the ever thicker growing mist, 
while trying to avoid the nasty traps, nature has imposed on these swamp-
lands. A tall pollard willow looms up ahead of you from out of the mist. 
The suddenness of its appearance and the fact that it is so near, startles 
you and causes a moment of distraction that is fatal to you, for in that 
single moment, you step into a pool of quicksand. You curse the day that you 
set foot into these damned marshes, but that, nor all the swearing of the 
world for that matter, doesn't help you and you are inevitably drawn into 
the quicksand's depths.

quite as tall, but much closer to you. Hope flows back into your heart as you

Inside the Open North Gate of Midgaard~
Two small towers surround a warped wooden gate which lies half hanging on
its hinges.  The towers are connected by a small stone bridge set with
murder holes.  The hole stone structure is covered with plants.  You can
leave midgaard to the north, or continues along wall road to the west and
east.  A lonely market street is visible to the south, and beyond that the
once graceful spires of the Temple of Mota, but there is no way to reach
them from here.
